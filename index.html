Written and published first by Antoine de St-Exup�ry in 1943, only a year before his plane disappeared on a reconnaissance flight, it is one of the world's most widely translated books, enjoyed by adults and children alike. In the meeting of the narrator who has ditched his plane in the Sahara desert, and the little prince, who has dropped there through time and space from his tiny asteroid, comes an intersection of two worlds, the one governed by the laws of nature, and the other determined only by the limits of imagination. The world of the imagination wins hands down, with the concerns of the adult world often shown to be lamentably silly as seen through the eyes of the little prince. While adult readers can find deep meanings in his various encounters, they can also be charmed back to childhood by this wise but innocent infant. <p></p> This popular translation contains the author's own delightful illustrations, bringing to visual life the small being at the tale's heart, and a world of fantasy far removed from any quotidian reality. It is also a sort of love story, in which two frail beings, the downed pilot and the wandering infant-prince who has left behind all he knows, share their short time together isolated from humanity and finding sustenance in each other. This is a book which creates a unique relationship with each reader, whether child or adult.</p><p></p><h2>The Handbook for Spiritual Warfare</h2><p>We are at war. The evidence is all around us. Child abuse. Epidemic drug and alcohol addiction. Government corruption. Random murder in the streets. The list goes on and on as never before. How can Christians fight back? How can we arm ourselves in this spiritual war to help win the victory for and through Christ? With these questions in mind, Dr. Ed Murphy offers a thorough, Bible-based look at the subject of spiritual warfare. With compelling power and urgency, Murphy surveys spiritual warfare in the Old and New Testaments to help us understand and overcome evil in all three dimensions: the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. Murphy also offers fascinating answers to the most- frequently-asked questions about spiritual warfare; provides a shocking, true account of how he dealt with the demonization of his own daughter, and offers biblical guidance and hope for Christians fighting the spiritual war for Christ. The Handbook for Spiritual Warfare is an essential tool for all of us who understand and engage in all three dimensions of spiritual warfare, leading to ultimate victory in Jesus Christ.</p><p><b>Dr. Ed Murphy</b> is known worldwide for his training and counseling work in the area of spiritual warfare.

He arrived about five o'clock on an afternoon of sunshine in mid June, and the old red-brick house, lodged on a southern slope of the Surrey hills, was glowing from a dark forest depth of pines with the warmth of a rare jewel. Lieutenant Sutch limped across the hall, where the portraits of the Fevershams rose one above the other to the ceiling, and went out on to the stone-flagged terrace at the back. There he found his host sitting erect like a boy, and gazing southwards towards the Sussex Downs.</p><p>"How's the leg?" asked General Feversham, as he rose briskly from his chair. He was a small wiry man, and, in spite of his white hairs, alert. But the alertness was of the body. A bony face, with a high narrow forehead and steel-blue inexpressive eyes, suggested a barrenness of mind.</p><p>"It gave me trouble during the winter," replied Sutch. "But that was to be expected." General Fever-sham nodded, and for a little while both men were silent. From the terrace the ground fell steeply to a wide level plain of brown earth and emerald fields and dark clumps of trees. From this plain voices rose through the sunshine, small but very clear. Far away towards Horsham a coil of white smoke from a train snaked rapidly in and out amongst the trees; and on the horizon rose the Downs, patched with white chalk.</p><p>"I thought that I should find you here," said Sutch.</p><p>"It was my wife's favourite corner," answered Feversham, in a quite emotionless voice. "She would sit here by the hour. She had a queer liking for wide and empty spaces."</p><p>"Yes," said Sutch. "She had imagination. Her thoughts could people them."</p><p>General Feversham glanced at his companion as though he hardly understood. But he asked no questions. What he did not understand he habitually let slip from his mind as not worth comprehension. He spoke at once upon a different topic.</p><p>"There will be a leaf out of our table to-night."</p><p>"Yes. Collins, Barberton, and Vaughan went this winter. Well, we are all permanently shelved upon the world's half-pay list as it is. The obituary column is just the last formality which gazettes us out of the Service altogether," and Sutch stretched out and eased his crippled leg, which fourteen years ago that day had been crushed and twisted in the fall of a scaling-ladder.</p><p>"I am glad that you came before the others," continued Feversham. "I would like to take your opinion. This day is more to me than the anniversary of our attack upon the Redan. At the very moment when we were standing under arms in the dark -- "</p><p>"To the west of the quarries, I remember," interrupted Sutch, with a deep breath. "How should one forget?"</p><p>"At that very moment Harry was born in this house. I thought, therefore, that if you did not object he might join us to-night. He happens to be at home. He will, of course, enter the service, and he might learn something, perhaps, which afterwards will be of use -- one never knows."</p><p>"By all means," said Sutch, with alacrity. For since his visits to General Feversham were limited to the occasion of these anniversary dinners, he had never yet seen Harry Feversham.</p><p>Sutch had for many years been puzzled as to the qualities in General Feversham which had attracted Muriel Graham, a woman as remarkable for the refinement of her intellect as for the beauty of her person; and he could never find an explanation. He had to be content with his knowledge that for some mysterious reason she had married this man so much older than herself, and so unlike to her in character. Personal courage and an indomitable self-confidence were the chief, indeed the only qualities which sprang to light in General Feversham. Lieutenant Sutch went back in thought over twenty years as he sat on his garden-chair to a time before he had taken part, as an officer of the Naval Brigade, in that unsuccessful onslaught on the Redan. He remembered a season in London to which he had come fresh from the China Station; and he was curious to see Harry Feversham. He did not admit that it was more than the natural curiosity of a man who, disabled in comparative youth, had made a hobby out of the study of human nature. He was interested to see whether the lad took after his mother or his father -- that was all.</p><p>So that night Harry Feversham took a place at the dinner-table and listened to the stories which his elders told, while Lieutenant Sutch watched him. The stories were all of that dark winter in the Crimea, and a fresh story was always in the telling before its predecessor was ended. They were stories of death, of hazardous exploits; of the pinch of famine and the chill of snow. But they were told in clipped words and with a matter-of-fact tone, as though the men who related them were only conscious of them as far-off things; and there was seldom a comment more pronounced than a mere "that's curious," or an exclamation more significant than a laugh.</p><p>But Harry Feversham sat listening as though the incidents thus carelessly narrated were happening actually at that moment and within the walls of that room. His dark eyes -- the eyes of his mother -- turned with each story from speaker to speaker, and waited wide-open and fixed until the last word was spoken. He listened fascinated and enthralled. And so vividly did the changes of expression shoot and quiver across his face, that it seemed to Sutch the lad must actually hear the drone of bullets in the air, actually resist the stunning shock of a charge, actually ride down in the thick of a squadron to where guns screeched out a tongue of flame from a fog. Once a major of artillery spoke of the suspense of the hours between the parading of the troops before a battle and the first command to advance; and Harry's shoulders worked under the intolerable strain of those lagging minutes.</p><p>But he did more than work his shoulders. He threw a single furtive, wavering glance backwards; and Lieutenant Sutch was startled, and indeed more than startled, he was pained. For this, after all, was Muriel Graham's boy.</p><p>The look was too familiar a one to Sutch. He had seen it on the faces of recruits during their first experience of a battle too often for him to misunderstand it. And one picture in particular rose before his mind. An advancing square at Inkermann, and a tall big soldier rushing forward from the line in the eagerness of his attack, and then stopping suddenly as though he suddenly understood that he was alone, and had to meet alone the charge of a mounted Cossack. Sutch remembered very clearly the fatal wavering glance which the big soldier had thrown backwards towards his companions -- a glance accompanied by a queer sickly smile. He remembered, too, with equal vividness, its consequence. For though the soldier carried a loaded musket and a bayonet locked to the muzzle, he had without an effort of self-defence received the Cossack's lance-thrust in his throat.</p><p>Sutch glanced hurriedly about the table, afraid that General Feversham, or that some one of his guests, should have remarked the same look and the same smile upon Harry's face. But no one had eyes for the lad; each visitor was waiting too eagerly for an opportunity to tell a story of his own. Sutch drew a breath of relief and turned to Harry. But the boy was sitting with his elbows on the cloth and his head propped between his hands, lost to the glare of the room and its glitter of silver, constructing again out of the swift succession of anecdotes a world of cries and wounds, and maddened riderless chargers and men writhing in a fog of cannon-smoke. The curtest, least graphic description of the biting days and nights in the trenches set the lad shivering. Even his face grew pinched, as though the iron frost of that winter was actually eating into his bones. Sutch touched him lightly on the elbow.</p><p>"You renew those days for me," said he. "Though the heat is dripping down the windows, I feel the chill of the Crimea."</p><p>Harry roused himself from his absorption.</p><p>"The stories renew them," said he.</p><p>"No. It is you listening to the stories."</p><p>And before Harry could reply, General Feversham's voice broke sharply in from the head of the table -- </p><p>"Harry, look at the clock!"</p><p>At once all eyes were turned upon the lad. The hands of the clock made the acutest of angles. It was close upon midnight, and from eight, without so much as a word or a question, he had sat at the dinner-table listening. Yet even now he rose with reluctance.</p><p>"Must I go, father?" he asked, and the General's guests intervened in a chorus. The conversation was clear gain to the lad, a first taste of powder which might stand him in good stead afterwards.</p><p>"Besides, it's the boy's birthday," added the major of artillery. "He wants to stay, that's plain. You wouldn't find a youngster of fourteen sit all these hours without a kick of the foot against the table-leg unless the conversation entertained him. Let him stay, Feversham!"</p><p>For once General Feversham relaxed the iron discipline under which the boy lived.</p><p>"Very well," said he. "Harry shall have an hour's furlough from his bed. A single hour won't make much difference."</p><p>Harry's eyes turned towards his father, and just for a moment rested upon his face with a curious steady gaze. It seemed to Sutch that they uttered a question, and, rightly or wrongly, he interpreted the question into words -- </p><p>"Are you blind?"</p><p>But General Feversham was already talking to his neighbours, and Harry quietly sat down, and again propping his chin upon his hands, listened with all his soul. Yet he was not entertained; rather he was enthralled, he sat quiet under the compulsion of a spell. His face became unnaturally white, his eyes unnaturally large, while the flames of the candles shone ever redder and more blurred through a blue haze of tobacco-smoke, and the level of the wine grew steadily lower in the decanters.</p><p>Thus half of that one hour's furlough was passed; and then General Feversham, himself jogged by the unlucky mention of a name, suddenly blurted out in his jerky fashion -- </p><p>"Lord Wilmington. One of the best names in Eng...</p></p><h2>Glencoe Physical iScience, Module M: Atoms &amp; Elements, Grade 8, Student Edition (GLEN SCI: MOTION, FORCES, ENER)</h2><p>Print student edition, Atoms and Elements</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Mudras for Modern Life: Boost your health, re-energize your life, enhance your yoga and deepen your meditation</h2><p>This new, definitive, fully illustrated guide to the ancient art of mudras provides a highly practical and inspirational overview of how to use subtle yogic hand gestures to revitalize every aspect of your life<br><br>In this new, beautifully presented guide to the ancient art of mudras ? an often overlooked Eastern practice that involves making established hand gestures to direct subtle energy to boost health and wellbeing ? readers will discover how to integrate more than 60 mudras into their daily life and/or yoga and meditation practice for increased vitality and inner peace.

Written over 1,000 years ago, it was meant to protect Persian collective memory amidst a turbulent sea of cultural storms. Originally written in couplets, the translation and adaptation by Ahmad Sadri retells the mythological tales in prose format. The spectacular illustrations in this edition were created from elements culled from thousands of manuscripts, lithographs, and miniatures dating from the thirteenth through the nineteenth centuries, and each panel becomes a new work of art, an exquisite collage of traditional forms. 500 + full-color illustrations</p><p>The ancient legends of the Persian Book of Kings (Shahnameh)1 were versified by Abolqasem Ferdowsi (940-1020 CE), who was born to a -family of small landowners near the city of Tus, in northeastern Iran. He dedicated thirty-three years of his life to Shahnameh and finished its second redaction one thousand and three years ago, in March 1010.&nbsp;Shahnameh is of the essence of Iranian nationhood. Unlike the Egyptian, Syrian, and other North African populations of the Roman Empire that were thoroughly Arabized after their Islamic conquest in the seventh century, Persians were able to hold on to their language and calendar even after they converted to Islam. It has been argued that this was made possible because the Iranians' national identity was not fully invested in their pre-Islamic faith. Rather, it resided in a secular body of myth and legend that they preserved and which later would form the basis of Ferdowsi's great work. To this day men, women, and children in Persianate societies from Asia Minor to China are able to recite lines of Shahnameh by heart. The book continues to be read in family gatherings and performed by professional reciters in the teahouses of Tajikistan, Iran, and Afghanistan.It was awareness of this living tradition of Shahnameh recitations that gave me and my colleagues Melissa Hibbard and Hamid Rahmanian the -audacity to go where angels fear to tread. As we embarked on the -journey to -create a new edition of Iran's national epic with freshly narrated -stories printed against a fully illustrated backdrop, we consoled ourselves that we were -walking in the footsteps of generations of previous performers and illustrators.&nbsp;I never forgot the first reciter of Shahnameh I saw at the age of seven somewhere near the city of Karaj. He wore a leather vest studded with shiny spikes and wielded a short cane that was his only prop. That lone cane turned into a sword, a mace, and even the neck of a neighing horse. The performer paced rapidly back and forth producing a range of sound effects for galloping horses, clashing swords, and collapsing rocks. He sonorously intoned the poems of Shahnameh in the middle of his prose narration as he played all of the parts from the last scenes of the battle of Rostam and Sohrab. What is remarkable is that I still remember not only the performance but also the pictures I made in my head as it went on. The session ended with a cliffhanger as the hero Rostam climbed a pile of rocks, put his neck in a self-made noose, and kicked the rocks from beneath him to commit suicide. Later I learned that this final scene was not in any of the known copies of Shahnameh. But the knowledge did not diminish the worth of that performance because I also knew that the stories existed and evolved both before and after the completion of Ferdowsi's magnum opus.Foreword by Sheila Canby, Metropolitan Museum of Art<br>Shahnameh: The Epic of the Persian Kings is the latest in a long tradition of illustrated texts of the Persian national epic. From the early fourteenth century, paintings of the most colorful and dramatic episodes in Ferdowsi's poem accompanied the written text. At first, the manuscripts were small and their illustrations appeared in bands across part of the written page. Even then artists did not hesitate to break through the frame and extend pictorial elements into the margins. By the 1330s royal and noble patrons were commissioning large-scale Shahnameh manuscripts with illustrations that were more complex in both their composition and the interaction of the figures than the earlier versions. In the fifeenth century the production of illustrated Shahnamehs increased, ranging from the most outstanding princely manuscript made for the grandson of Timur (Tamerlane) in Herat in 1430 to the numerous Turkmen-style manuscripts from Shiraz created to satisfy the growing market for such books. Illustrated Shahnamehs were not produced for Iranians alone, but were exported to the Ottoman Empire and India, where they inspired copies with paintings in the prevailing style of the region. The tradition of opulent royal Shahnamehs persisted in the sixteenth century, notably under Shah Tahmasp whose manuscript contained 258 remarkable illustrations. Although at times interest in illustrated Shahnamehs waned, the epic remained central to the poetic education of Persian-speakers. Even in the nineteenth century, when court artists were busy painting in oil on canvas or in lacquer on boxes and book covers, the new art of lithography was applied to illustrating the&nbsp;Shahnameh. Hamid Rahmanian's new volume incorporates images that span the history of Shahnameh illustration, excerpting and weaving together figures familiar from many of the greatest manuscripts. Recognizing how broadly dispersed are the people in whose culture the Shahnameh plays a significant role, Rahmanian has employed the modern technology of the filmmaker and graphic artist to produce images that will appeal to a modern audience. Anyone who has read the Shahnameh realizes that it is far from an iteration of battles; its stories involve love and luck, dreams and demons, prowess and political intrigue. In fact, the gamut of human emotion appears in the&nbsp;Shahnameh. As in the Shahnamehs of past centuries, this book's many illustrations do more than translate the narrative episode into visual form. Rather, the illustrations and text enable a reader to contemplate the thoughts and actions of the protagonists while poring over the recombined details of a variety of earlier Shahnameh images. Many of the illustrations contain colors that recall those in Persian miniatures, but they have been intensified in keeping with a modern, cinematic sensibility. Likewise, the dynamic silhouetting of pictorial details mitigates the stylization of the earlier paintings that make up the compositions in this book. The varying scale of figures within individual illustrations breaks the conventions of earlier miniature painting, but for the modern viewer this corresponds to the distortions one finds, for example, in science fiction. In fact, the dreamscape of the real and imaginary worlds found in the illustrations of this Shahnameh, while totally dependent on the art of the past, most closely evokes the fantasy literature of today in visual form. Thanks to the dramatic dynamism of Ferdowsi's epic, its contemporary interpretation in images is a vibrant feast for the imagination, making this a Shahnameh for the digital age.</p><h2>The Art of Is: Improvising as a Way of Life</h2><p><strong>A MASTERFUL BOOK ABOUT BREATHING LIFE INTO ART AND ART INTO LIFE<br> </strong><br> &#x201c;Stephen Nachmanovitch&#x2019;s <em>The Art of Is</em> is a philosophical meditation on living, living fully, living in the present. To the author, an improvisation is a co-creation that arises out of listening and mutual attentiveness, out of a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity. It is a product of the nervous system, bigger than the brain and bigger than the body; it is a once-in-a-lifetime encounter, unprecedented and unrepeatable. Drawing from the wisdom of the ages, <em>The Art of Is</em> not only gives the reader an inside view of the states of mind that give rise to improvisation, it is also a celebration of the power of the human spirit, which &#x2014; when exercised with love, immense patience, and discipline &#x2014; is an antidote to hate.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Yo-Yo Ma,</strong> cellist</p><p>An improvisational violinist and the author of the classic work <em>Free Play</em>, <strong>Stephen Nachmanovitch, PhD,</strong> performs and teaches internationally at the intersections of multimedia, performing arts, ecology, and philosophy.&#x201c;In an age of standardized packages and constrained choices, Stephen Nachmanovitch gives us <em>The Art of Is</em>, a refreshing encounter with how to improvise and be fully alive in the face of deadening habits of mind. The author is a musician and a teacher who has an uncanny ability to see and listen and help others do likewise. We are verbs, not nouns, he tells us, because we are ever in motion &#x2014; open to change and surprise. Like musicians who improvise together, human beings can break barriers: teaching, playing, creating, and being present to one another. In clear prose, Nachmanovitch effortlessly shows how people discover &#x2014; in themselves &#x2014; the sheer power to relate and endlessly adapt.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Jerry Brown,</strong> governor of California 1975&#x2013;1982 and 2011&#x2013;2018<br> <br> &#x201c;A beautiful book, full of power, full of life, written from the deep experience of an artist and a wise person.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Joan Halifax,</strong> abbot, Upaya Zen Center<br> <br> &#x201c;<em>The Art of Is</em> IS real ART! It is so lucid, grand, kind, easygoing, and deeply helpful, I could not stop reading it, even in time I did not &#x2018;have&#x2019;! It is full of surprises, gems, and open-ended inspirations. It starts from the moment of Mahalia Jackson&#x2019;s startling outburst to MLK Jr., catapulting his &#x201c;I have a dream&#x201d; speech into the improvisation of a soaring liberation of the spirit that it was. Stephen Nachmanovitch takes us with him on his life-walk of love in music all over the world. He delivers us to a place of new vitality in our own lives where we more fully recognize the harmonies at hand. This is a lovely guidebook for our own journeys, helping us appreciate ourselves and each other as the precious human beings endowed with liberty and opportunity that we are!&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Robert Thurman,</strong> Jey Tsong Khapa Professor of Buddhist Studies, Columbia University, co-founder of Tibet House<br> <br> &#x201c;Stephen Nachmanovitch brings forty years of practicing improv to the page and offers a rich trove, hard-won and long-pondered. In graceful prose that reflects not only his talking the talk but walking the walk, he explores the art of being present. You&#x2019;ll finish the book enriched by his experiences studying under Zen masters and his mentor, the great polymath Gregory Bateson, and teaching aspiring improvisers all over the world.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Randy Fertel, </strong>author of<em> A Taste for Chaos: The Art of Literary Improvisation<br> </em><br> &#x201c;Stephen Nachmanovitch beautifully reveals a world of communication and co-creation that is both new and ancient. To play in this realm of improvisation is to recognize the tenderness with which interdependence knows aloneness, and the way silence defines sound. The stories he tells show us that the complexity and simplicity of life itself exist in our interrelationships. These findings are laid out in this book with grace, humor, and careful articulation. Nachmanovitch makes it clear that the art of being human now is acutely tied into an improvisational way of being: making sense of ourselves, each other, and the natural world in ways that find new offerings within old patterns. It is to feel anew.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Nora Bateson,</strong> filmmaker, International Bateson Institute<br> <br> &#x201c;<em>The Art of Is</em> gives us a precious philosophical prescription for engaging the creative opportunities of our life as the greatest work of art.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Alex Grey,</strong> artist</p><h2>The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Building and Programming Robots</h2><p>LEGO MINDSTORMS has changed the way we think about robotics by making it possible for anyone to build real, working robots.

The most sensitive questions sought to probe through the centuries and discover the original Jesus. Why, scholars asked, is the New Testament silent about most of Jesus's life? Why didn't Paul say more about the life of Jesus? To what extent was Jesus Jewish? How significant were the differences among the Gospels? What evidence could be trusted and what views justified? As scholars sought to discover and describe what they thought the "true" Jesus might be, they proved that Jesus could be many things. </p><p>In this broad survey of the efforts to establish, amend, or deny the historical Jesus, Albert Schweitzer presents the history of a debate about what mattered most to millions of people: If God had entered human history, what could history tell about it? Throughout the course of this heated and prolonged dispute, one retelling of the life of Jesus followed another, enjoying&#x2015;in Schweitzer's phrase&#x2015;"the immortality of revised editions." </p><p>Lesser writers might consider differences of opinion as signs of a hopeless enterprise, but Schweitzer instead finds immense value in the differences. Approaches and conclusions may differ, he concludes, but the quest for the historical Jesus has provided ample testimony to the importance of the effort and the rewards of the experience.</p></p><p><p><b>Albert Schweitzer </b> (1875-1965) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952. While still a young man he demonstrated extraordinary abilities in a wide range of pursuits, including science, theology, and music. In 1908 he published his magisterial study of the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach. He studied medicine from 1905 to 1913 at the University of Strasbourg, then founded a hospital in French Equatorial Africa, where he spent most of the remainder of his life. Schweitzer used his Nobel Prize stipend to expand the hospital and to build a leper colony.

In 1951, he published his first novel, Galactic Storm, at the age of just 17, and went on to write dozens of novels under his own and various house names until his death in 1995 at the Glasgow Worldcon.

After nine years on death row, DNA testing cast doubt on his conviction and saved his life. However, he spent another eight years in prison before more sophisticated DNA technology proved his innocence and convicted the guilty man.</p><p>DNA exonerations have shattered confidence in the criminal justice system by exposing how often we have convicted the innocent and let the guilty walk free. In this unsettling in-depth analysis, Brandon Garrett examines what went wrong in the cases of the first 250 wrongfully convicted people to be exonerated by DNA testing.</p><p>Based on trial transcripts, Garrett&#x2019;s investigation into the causes of wrongful convictions reveals larger patterns of incompetence, abuse, and error. Evidence corrupted by suggestive eyewitness procedures, coercive interrogations, unsound and unreliable forensics, shoddy investigative practices, cognitive bias, and poor lawyering illustrates the weaknesses built into our current criminal justice system. Garrett proposes practical reforms that rely more on documented, recorded, and audited evidence, and less on fallible human memory. </p><p>Very few crimes committed in the United States involve biological evidence that can be tested using DNA. How many unjust convictions are there that we will never discover? <i>Convicting the Innocent</i> makes a powerful case for systemic reforms to improve the accuracy of all criminal cases.</p></p><p>Brandon L. Garrett is the L. Neil Williams, Jr., Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law.&#x201c;For six years now I have worked diligently within the innocence movement, and I often hear the question: 'How do wrongful convictions happen?' <i>Convicting the Innocent</i> gives all the answers. It is a fascinating study of what goes wrong, and it clearly shows that virtually all wrongful convictions could have been avoided.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Grisham</b><br><br>&#x201c;DNA testing is revolutionizing our system of criminal justice: this book shows why. By digging deep into the case files of exonerees, Brandon Garrett uncovers what went wrong in those cases and probably in many more we simply can't know about. Garrett makes a powerful case for how to improve criminal justice so that we dramatically reduce the number of wrongly convicted.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, The Innocence Project</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is an invaluable book, a comprehensive, highly readable but well-researched work examining the hows and whys of the law's ultimate nightmare&#x2015;convicting the innocent.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Scott Turow, author of <i>Innocent</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;How can we stop sending innocent people to our prisons?

But what exactly do we see when we look through that window? Until now the answer has been pretty sketchy. Brandon Garrett has produced a far more detailed and complete picture of the lessons of DNA exonerations than anything else to date. This is an indispensable book for anyone wanting to understand or improve American criminal justice.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Samuel R.

One can only hope that they will mobilize a broad range of citizens, liberal and conservative, to demand legislative and judicial reforms ensuring that the innocent go free whether or not the constable has blundered.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeffrey Rosen</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Looking at the 250 people exonerated through DNA as of February 2010, Garrett aimed to determine how often...malignant factors had warped the criminal justice process at the expense of an innocent person (and to the benefit of an actual criminal who went unpursued). Garrett tracked down court transcripts and dug into case files. He then sliced, diced, sifted and collated the data. Some law professors would take a pass on this kind of grunt work. Garrett did not, and our justice system can be the better for it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kevin Doyle</b><b>, </b><b><i>America</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;While false convictions are a recognized phenomenon, Garrett focuses much needed attention on potential solutions, offering concrete suggestions for reform.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book details some of the worst miscarriages of justice in U.S. history and describes how DNA evidence helped to right those wrongs...The book, what must be the most thorough treatment yet of wrongful convictions, is a first-rate examination of the human foibles and conflicts of interest hampering the pursuit of justice.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A.

While the volume is certainly handy to someone struggling with grammar basics-there are few style guides so breezy-the "Verbal Abuse" section will appeal to language experts and purists, especially those who decry the use of partner as a verb, or grow with a direct object (as in "grow the business"). As for those who like to use dialogue as a verb, "Don't talk to them," O'Connor says. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Testimony: Writers of the West Speak on Behalf of Utah Wilderness</h2><p>Distinguished writers, including John McPhee, Barry Lopez, William Kittredge, Ann Zwinger, and Mark Strand, speak out on the necessity to protect and preserve America&#39;s wilderness habitats in the face of assaults on government-protected lands by miners, developers, and other industries.

M. Forster&#39;s A Passage to India, published in 1924, at the height of the Indian independence movement. Centering on an ambiguous incident between a young Englishwoman of uncertain stability and an Indian doctor eager to know his conquerors better, Forster&#39;s book explores, with unexampled profundity, both the historical chasm between races and the eternal one between individuals struggling to ease their isolation and make sense of their humanity. Written while England was still firmly in control of India, Forster&#39;s novel follows the fortunes of three English newcomers to India--Miss Adela Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Cyril Fielding--and the Indian, Dr. Aziz, with whom they cross destinies. The idea of true friendship between the races was a radical one in Forster&#39;s time, and he makes it abundantly clear that it was not one that either side welcomed. If Aziz&#39;s friend, Hamidullah, believed it impossible, the British representatives of the Raj were equally discouraging. &#34;Why, the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die,&#34; said Mrs. Callendar. &#34;How if he went to heaven?&#34; asked Mrs. Moore, with a gentle but crooked smile. &#34;He can go where he likes as long as he doesn&#39;t come near me. They give me the creeps.&#34; Despite their countrymen&#39;s disapproval, Miss Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Mr. Fielding are all eager to meet Indians, and in Dr. Aziz they find a perfect companion: educated, westernized, and open-minded. Slowly, the friendships ripen, especially between Aziz and Fielding. Having created the possibility of esteem based on trust and mutual affection, Forster then subjects it to the crucible of racial hatred: during a visit to the famed Marabar caves, Miss Quested accuses Dr. Aziz of sexually assaulting her, then later recants during the frenzied trial that follows.</p><p>What really happened in the Marabar caves? This is the mystery at the heart of E.M. Forster's 1924 novel, <i>A Passage to India</i>, the puzzle that sets in motion events highlighting an even larger question: Can an Englishman and an Indian be friends? <p> "It is impossible here," an Indian character tells his friend, Dr. Aziz, early in the novel. </p><blockquote> "They come out intending to be gentlemen, and are told it will not do.... Why, I remember when Turton came out first. It was in another part of the Province. You fellows will not believe me, but I have driven with Turton in his carriage--Turton! Oh yes, we were once quite intimate. He has shown me his stamp collection. <p> "He would expect you to steal it now. Turton! But red-nosed boy will be far worse than Turton! </p><p> "I do not think so. They all become exactly the same, not worse, not better. I give any Englishman two years, be he Turton or Burton. It is only the difference of a letter. And I give any Englishwoman six months. All are exactly alike." </p></blockquote> Written while England was still firmly in control of India, Forster's novel follows the fortunes of three English newcomers to India--Miss Adela Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Cyril Fielding--and the Indian, Dr. Aziz, with whom they cross destinies. The idea of true friendship between the races was a radical one in Forster's time, and he makes it abundantly clear that it was not one that either side welcomed. If Aziz's friend, Hamidullah, believed it impossible, the British representatives of the Raj were equally discouraging. <blockquote> "Why, the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die," said Mrs. Callendar.<br> "How if he went to heaven?" asked Mrs. Moore, with a gentle but crooked smile.<br> "He can go where he likes as long as he doesn't come near me. They give me the creeps." </blockquote> Despite their countrymen's disapproval, Miss Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Mr. Fielding are all eager to meet Indians, and in Dr. Aziz they find a perfect companion: educated, westernized, and open-minded. Slowly, the friendships ripen, especially between Aziz and Fielding. Having created the possibility of esteem based on trust and mutual affection, Forster then subjects it to the crucible of racial hatred: during a visit to the famed Marabar caves, Miss Quested accuses Dr. Aziz of sexually assaulting her, then later recants during the frenzied trial that follows. Under such circumstances, affection proves to be a very fragile commodity indeed. <p> Arguably Forster's greatest novel, <i>A Passage to India</i> limns a troubling portrait of colonialism at its worst, and is remarkable for the complexity of its characters. Here the personal becomes the political and in the breach between Aziz and his English "friends," Forster foreshadows the eventual end of the Raj. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: The Movie Storybook (The Chronicles of Narnia)</h2><p><p>An ordinary game of hide-and-seek leads to the discovery of a lifetime!

Their mission was to build trust until they could acquire accurate information about the activities of a nearby warlord believed to be harboring some operatives of Al Qaeda.<br> <br>All four soldiers were highly trained for their Special Ops assignment. Which meant that they understood a great deal about local agriculture and husbandry, trade, food storage, and other issues on which the survival and prosperity of the village depended. They had arrived with rudimentary skills in the pertinent languages, but now they were reasonably fluent in the language of the village.<br> <br>The village girls were beginning to find occasions to walk near whatever project the American soldiers were working on. But the soldiers ignored them, and by now the parents of these girls knew they were safe enough&#x2014;though that didn&#x2019;t stop them from rebuking the girls for their immodesty with men who were, after all, unbelievers and foreigners and dangerous men.<br> <br>For these American soldiers had also been trained to kill&#x2014;silently or noisily, close at hand or from a distance, individually or in groups, with weapons or without.<br> <br>They had killed no one in front of these villagers, and in fact they had killed no one, ever, anywhere. Yet there was something about them, their alertness, the way they moved, that gave warning, the way a tiger gives warning simply by the fluidity of its movement and the alertness of its eyes.<br> <br>There came a day that one of the villagers, a young man who had been away for a week, came home, and within a few minutes had told his news to the elder who, for lack of anyone better, was regarded by the villagers as the wisest counselor. He, in turn, brought the young man to the Americans.<br> <br>The terrorists, he said, were building up a cache of weapons away to the southwest. The local warlord had not given his consent&#x2014;in fact, he disapproved, but would not dare to intervene. &#x201c;He would be as happy as anyone to be rid of these men. They frighten him as much as they frighten everyone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>The young man was also, obviously, afraid.<br> <br>The Americans got directions from him and strode out of the camp, following one of the trails the shepherds used.<br> <br>When they were behind the first hill&#x2014;though this &#x201c;hill&#x201d; in most other places would have been called a mountain&#x2014;they stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a trap, of course,&#x201d; said one of the Americans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the leader, a young captain named Reuben Malich. &#x201c;But will they spring it when we reach the place where his directions would send us? Or when we return?&#x201d;<br> <br>In other words, as they all understood: Was the village part of the conspiracy or not? If it was, then the trap would be sprung far away.<br> <br>But if the villagers had not betrayed them (except for the one young man), then in all likelihood the village was in as much danger as the Americans.<br> <br>Captain Malich briefly discussed the possibilities with his team, so that by the time he gave his orders, they were all in complete agreement.<br> <br>A few minutes later, using routes they had planned on the first day, before they ever entered the village, they crested the hill at four separate vantage points and spotted the armed men who had just entered the village and were taking up many of the positions surrounding it that the Americans had guessed they would use.<br> <br>The Americans&#x2019; plan, in the event of such an ambush, was to approach these positions with stealth and kill the enemy one by one, silently.<br> <br>But now Captain Malich saw a scene playing out in the center of the village that he could not bear. For the old man had been brought out into the middle of the sunbaked dirt of the square, and a man with a sword was preparing to behead him.<br> <br>Captain Malich did the calculations in his head. Protect your own force&#x2014;that was a prime concern. But if it were the only priority, or the highest priority, nations would keep their armies at home and never commit them to battle at all.<br> <br>The higher priority here was the mission. If the village sustained any casualties, they would not care that the Americans saved them from even more. They would only grieve that the Americans had ever come at all, bringing such tragedy with them. They would beg the Americans to leave, and hate them if they did not go.<br> <br>Here were the terrorists, proving that they were, as suspected, operating in the area. This village had been a good choice. Which meant that it would be a terrible waste to lose the trust that had been built up.<br> <br>Captain Malich took his own weapon and, adjusting wind and distance, took careful aim and killed the swordsman with a single shot.<br> <br>The other three Americans understood immediately the change of plans. They took aim at the enemies who would be able to take cover most easily, and killed them. Then they settled down to shooting the others one by one.<br> <br>Of course, the enemy were firing back. Captain Malich himself was hit, but his body armor easily dealt with a weapon fired at such long range. And as the enemy fire slackened, Malich counted the enemy dead and compared it to the number he had seen in the village, moving from building to building. He gave the hand signal that told the rest of his team that he was going in, and they shot at anyone who seemed to be getting into position to kill him as he descended the slope.<br> <br>In only a few minutes, he was among the small buildings of the village. These walls would not stop bullets, and there were people cowering inside. So he did not expect to do a lot of shooting. This would be knife work.<br> <br>He was good at knife work. He hadn&#x2019;t known until now how easy it was to kill another man. The adrenalin coursing through him pushed aside the part of his mind that might be bothered by the killing. All he thought of at this moment was what he needed to do, and what the enemy might do to stop him, and the knife merely released the tension for a moment, until he started looking for the next target.<br> <br>By now his men were also in the village, doing their own variations on the same work. One of the soldiers encountered a terrorist who was holding a child as a hostage. There was no thought of negotiation. The American took aim instantly, fired, and the terrorist dropped dead with a bullet through his eye.<br> <br>At the end, the sole surviving terrorist panicked. He ran to the center of the square, where many of the villagers were still cowering, and leveled his automatic weapon to mow them down.<br> <br>The old man still had one last spring in his ancient legs, and he threw himself onto the automatic weapon as it went off.<br> <br>Captain Malich was nearest to the terrorist and shot him dead. But the old man had taken a mortal wound. By the time Malich got to him, the old man gave one last shudder and died in a puddle of the blood that had poured from his abdomen where the two bullets tore him open.<br> <br>Reuben Malich knelt over the body and cried out in the keening wail of deep grief, the anguish of a soul on fire. He tore open the shirt of his uniform and struck himself repeatedly on the chest. This was not part of his training. He had never seen anyone do such a thing, in any culture. Striking himself looked to his fellow soldiers like a kind of madness. But the surviving villagers joined him in grief, or watched him in awe.<br> <br>Within moments he was back on the job, interrogating the abject young betrayer while the other soldiers explained to the villagers that this boy was not the enemy, just a frightened kid who had been coerced and lied to by the terrorists and did not deserve to be killed.<br> <br>Six hours later, the terrorist base camp was pounded by American bombs; by noon the next day, it had been scoured to the last cave by American soldiers flown in by chopper.<br> <br>Then they were all pulled out.

Its first book, <b>Our Dumb Century</b>, was a <i>New York Times</i> #1 best-seller and winner of the 1999 Thurber Prize for American Humor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now <i>The Onion</i> returns&nbsp;&nbsp;with Volume One of&nbsp;&nbsp;the paper's greatest, most hard-hitting stories, including:<br>--Clinton Deploys Vowels to Bosnia: Operation Vowel Storm Will Make Countless Bosnian Names More Pronounceable<br>--Jesus Christ Returns to NBA<br>--Microsoft Patents Ones, Zeroes<br>--I Can't Stand My Filthy Hippy Owner by Thunder the Ferret</p><p>From the editors of the most hilarious periodical around comes <i>The Onion's Finest News Reporting</i>, a collection of stories and commentaries with a sublime satirical bite. Devotees of the Madison, Wisconsin, weekly will erupt with laughter at each turn of the page, while newcomers will wonder how they have done without such headlines as "Civil War Enthusiasts Burn Atlanta to Ground," "Saddam Hussein Steps Down Following Sex Scandal," "Lyndon Johnson Jr. Sworn in as <i>George</i> Editor," "Nation's Educators Alarmed by Poorly Written Teen Suicide Notes," and "Massive Oil Spill Results in Improved Wildlife Viscosity." The brilliant parodies following the headlines are consistently smart, irreverent, and hysterical. Some selections are masterworks of absurdity, such as op-ed pieces written from the perspectives of pylons, chemical plants, or appliances. The book also contains some choice picks from the magazine's "What Do You Think?" column, in which ordinary citizens sound off on timely topics such as the teaching of evolution in schools ("I am against evolution being taught in schools. I am also against widespread literacy and the refrigeration of food.") and the cloning of animals ("I can't believe it--imagine a whole field of sheep that all look alike!"). As with all effective satire, this volume seeks to hit society's raw nerves: homophobia, racism, sexism, even Canada--"Perky 'Canada' Has Own Government, Laws" reads one headline. But buyer beware: if Dave Barry is about your speed, you may find some of these stories (and the language) to be tasteless, if not offensive. Others will love this book for those very reasons. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i>Started by two University of Wisconsin undergraduates in 1988, <b>The Onion</b> began as an alternative weekly newspaper -- with an emphasis on parody -- in&nbsp;&nbsp;Madison. While some believe <b>The Onion</b> got its name from the slang for a "juicy news story," it was actually named when the two founders were short on cash and eating onion sandwiches. Editor-in-Chief Scott Dikkers worked as a cartoonist during <b>The Onion's</b> first year, then with Pete Haise, the current publisher, bought the paper from its founders. "For a long time we were kind of a <i>Weekly World News</i> parody combined with your usual sophomoric college-humor publication," says Dikkers. In 1995 Dikkers shifted the focus of the paper to a straight news parody and found the voice for which <b>The Onion</b> is known today.<br><br>In 1996, <b>The Onion</b> made an unprecedented launch into cyberspace, and www.theonion.com soon became one of the nation's most heavily visited Web sites. The newspaper edition is available in bookstores and newsstands nationwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a half-million readers online, more than 350,000 readers of the print edition, and millions of listeners to <b>The Onion Radio News</b> (broadcast on 72 stations nationwide), <b>The Onion</b> has been called "the most popular humor periodical in world history" by <i>The New Yorker</i>.<br><br>And the plaudits don't stop there.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> called it "genius" and <i>Rolling Stone</i> named Scott Dikkers one of the nation's top-ten favorite writers. <br><br>Scott Dikkers and the editorial staff of <b>The Onion</b> -- Robert&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel, Todd Hanson, Maria Schneider, Tim Harrod, Carol Kolb, John Krewson, Mike Loew, Joe Garden, Ben Karlin and David Javerbaum -- are based in Madison, Wisconsin.</p><h2>Women&#39;s Infidelity: Living In Limbo: What Women Really Mean When They Say &#34;I&#39;m Not Happy&#34;</h2><p>Is infidelity women&#x2019;s best kept secret?

When her vibrant mother was in her early fifties, she began to exhibit the early symptoms of this incurable malady. Roach's initial coping mechanism was denial.

Ultimately, she accepted the inevitable and was able to act constructively.

Montgomery, Vol. 3:</h2><p>Lucy Maud Montgomery (1874-1942), the author of the classic novel for children, <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>, kept extensive journals for most of her life, beginning them in 1889 when she was fourteen and continuing them until shortly before her death. An instant bestseller in Canada, the first volume of <em>The Selected Journals of L.M. Montgomery</em> covers the years up to 1910 and culminates in the publication of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>. The second volume (1910-1921) portrays Montgomery in the midst of great upheaval, both in her life and in the world around her. Now, the long-awaited third volume brings us through her middle years, a time when Montgomery's personal and professional lives are becoming even more complex.<br> Ranging from 1921-1929, this revealing journal documents her efforts to juggle the demands of motherhood, parish obligations, indifferent household help, grief at the loss of older friends and family--everyday struggles to balance a woman's social and domestic duties. Here she writes of the triumphs and trials of being a best-selling author: growing fame; the successful midwifery of her new heroines Emily and Marigold and a more adult novel, <em>The Blue Castle</em>; the struggle to allocate time for correspondence with publishers, fans, friends--and to actually write. We trace the happy conclusion of her lawsuits against an unscrupulous publisher and the disappointing outcome of a lawsuit arising in a minor automobile accident. And we learn of her personal worries: Ewan Macdonalds's envy of his wife's publishing and social success; the dark shadow cast by his attacks of melancholia; and her fear that her sons might evince similar tendencies. <br> In these years, Lucy Maud Montgomery turned more and more to her journals to record her insights, opinions, and epiphanies. These journals will not only intrigue every fan of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> and the other Anne books, but will also provide an intimate look at life as portrayed by this remarkable writer.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mary Rubio</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Waterston</strong> are both members of the Department of English at the University of Guelph.<br>'The third volume of Montgomery's journals, again superbly edited by Mary Rubio and Elizabeth Waterston, is a beacon of sound scholarship and fine balance.'

Ottawa Citizen<br><br>'Like the first two, it makes for compulsive reading as a document at once personal and brilliantly illuminative of a decade of our social history.'

Jane Juska is a smart, energetic divorc�e who decided she&#x2019;d been celibate too long, and placed the following personal ad in her favorite newspaper, The New York Review of Books:<br><br>Before I turn 67&#x2014;next March&#x2014;I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me. <br><br>This closing reference was a nod to her favorite author, of course. The response was overwhelming, and Juska took a sabbatical from teaching to meet some of the men who had replied. And since her ad made it clear that she wasn&#x2019;t expecting just hand-holding, her dates zipped from first base to home plate in record time. <br><br>Juska is a totally engaging, perceptive writer, funny and frank about her exploits. It&#x2019;s high time someone revealed the fact that older single people are as eager for sex and intimacy as their younger counterparts. Jane Juska&#x2019;s brave, honest memoir will probably raise eyebrows and blood pressure, but it will undoubtedly appeal to the very large audience of grown-up readers who will be fascinated and inspired by her daring adventure.</p><p><b>Advance praise for <i>A Round-Heeled Woman</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Feisty, charming, moving and wise, this page-turner of a memoir proves that life for a woman&#x2014;sexual and otherwise&#x2014;hardly stops at thirty-nine . . . forty-nine or fifty-nine.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Cathi</b> <b>Hanauer</b>, editor of <b>The Bitch in the House</b> and author of <b>My Sister&#x2019;s Bones</b><br><br>&#x201c;Juska has a good sense of humor, and of course, her favorite writer is Anthony Trollope.

Blair Lent lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>A veritable banquet of vibrant images and jocular rhymes awaits readers in this irresistible picture book, Goldstone's first, illustrated by Caldecott Medalist Lent (The Funny Little Woman). When the beasts decide to dine, a healthful and ethnically varied repast followsA"mosquitoes bring burritos," "fishes bring knishes" and "mice bring rice" (complete with chopsticks). The tasty, textured language will delight young children as they watch the parade of players with their props march across the pages. Lent layers handmade cut paper with printed patterns in a bouquet of delectable colorsAsalmon pink, pea green, blueberry, grape and mustard yellow. In one especially innovative spread, smiling blue fish roll boulder-like knishes while carrot-orange mosquitoes fly with burritos speared on their stingers. The early spreads introduce the dinner guests, each leading into the next (readers see the outstretched arm of a bear on the right, and turn the page to find the pear he palms), then, once the meal begins, the table starts to stretch (readers have only to revisit the cozy empty table at the opening). Chaos ensues as a puffin lands smack in the middle of a pie, a mosquito stings a fleeing antelope and mice cling to flying muffins. Animals, food, forks and text all go askew, until at last peace is restored: "The feast is done./ The beasts are full,/ so everybody claps./ The armadillos bring some pillows.../ ...and everybody naps."

This scene opens a novel of extraordinary scope and depth, a masterwork that traces the fate of myriad Europeans&#x2015;Hungarians, Jews, Germans, Gypsies&#x2015;across the treacherous years of the mid-twentieth century.</p><p>Three unusual men are at the heart of <i>Parallel Stories</i>: Hans von Wolkenstein, whose German mother is linked to secrets of fascist-Nazi collaboration during the 1940s; �gost Lippay Lehr, whose influential father has served Hungary's different political regimes for decades; and Andr�s Rott, who has his own dark record of mysterious activities abroad. The web of extended and interconnected dramas reaches from 1989 back to the spring of 1939, when Europe trembled on the edge of war, and extends to the bestial times of 1944&#x2013;45, when Budapest was besieged, the Final Solution devastated Hungary's Jews, and the war came to an end, and on to the cataclysmic Hungarian Revolution of October 1956. We follow these men from Berlin and Moscow to Switzerland and Holland, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea, and of course, from village to city in Hungary. The social and political circumstances of their lives may vary greatly, their sexual and spiritual longings may seem to each of them entirely unique, yet P�ter N�das's magnificent tapestry unveils uncanny reverberating parallels that link them across time and space.This is P�ter N�das's masterpiece&#x2015;eighteen years in the writing, a sensation in Hungary even before it was published, and almost four years in the translating. <i>Parallel Stories</i> is the first foreign translation of this daring, demanding, and momentous novel, and it confirms for an even larger audience what Hungary already knows: that it is the author's greatest work.</p></p><p><p><b>P�ter N�das</b> was born in Budapest in 1942. Among his works translated into English are the novels <i>A Book of Memories </i>(FSG, 1997), <i>The End of a Family Story </i>(FSG, 1998), and <i>Love </i>(FSG, 2000); a collection of stories and essays, <i>Fire and Knowledge </i>(FSG, 2007); and two pieces of short fiction, <i>A Lovely Tale of Photography </i>and <i>P�ter N�das: Own Death</i>. He lives with his wife in Gombosszeg, Hungary.</p><i>Patricide</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In that memorable year when the famous Berlin wall came down, a corpse was discovered in the Tiergarten not far from the graying marble statue of Queen Louise. This happened a few days before Christmas.<br>The corpse was that of a well-groomed man of about fifty, and everything he wore or had on him appeared to be of better quality. At first glance a gentleman of some consequence, a banker or a senior manager. Snow was falling slowly, but it was not very cold, so the flakes melted on the paths of the park; only the blades of grass retained a white edge. The investigators did everything by the book and, because of the weather conditions, worked quickly. They closed off the area and proceeding clockwise in a narrowing spiral course searched it thoroughly so they could record and secure all existing clues. Behind an improvised screen of black plastic sheets, they carefully undressed the corpse but found no signs indicating suicide.<br>A young man who ran in the park every dawn had discovered the body. He was the only one the investigators could question. It had been completely dark when he set out, and he ran almost every day on the same path at the same time.<br>Had it not been so, had not everything been routine and habit, had not every stone and shadow been engraved in his mind&#x2019;s eye, he most probably would not have discovered the body. The light of distant streetlamps barely reached this far. The reason he noticed the body, lying on and half dangling off a bench, was, he explained excitedly to the policemen, because on the dark coat the snow had not melted at all. And as he was running at a steady pace, he related a bit too loudly, the whiteness flashed into his eyes from the side.<br>While he was talking, several men busied themselves inside the roped-off area. They were working, one might say, in ideal conditions; there was not a soul in the park besides them, no nosy curiosity seekers. Using a flashbulb, one of the men photographed something on the bare, wet ground that two forensic technicians had already labeled with a number.<br>As he began his story for the third time, the young man noticed nervously that every clue had been numbered and the sight made him very anxious. He felt as if he had been not the one who discovered the corpse or reported it but, rather, the culprit instantly confronted with physical evidence of his crime.<br>He was like a blade, though he could not tell of what, perhaps of a razor or an icy thought, but of that he said nothing.<br>In fact, his first thought was that he had murdered his own father. He could not understand why he had such a thought, why he would wish the death of this man, but of that too he said nothing to the police officers.<br>Hardly anything remained of which he could speak aloud.<br>But they paid little attention to him; both uniformed and plainclothesmen were going about their business, and from time to time they mumbled to one another phrases the young man could not understand.<br>They would not delay him further. Twice he had given them his personal data, they had registered his willingness to give evidence later in court, and still he could not leave.<br>Some of the policemen were being relieved by others around him.<br>When he runs, he repeated excitedly in his report, he does not look at anything or in any specific direction, and he does not think. From a psychological viewpoint, that is the essence of running at an even pace. But when twenty minutes later he again ran past the body on the bench, it occurred to him that the snow could remain intact like that only on a cooled-off corpse.<br>He had read something like that somewhere. And that&#x2019;s when he stopped to take a closer look.<br>In Berlin&#x2019;s Tiergarten, or game preserve, many things have happened already, or, more correctly, hardly anything can happen here that hasn&#x2019;t occurred before. The police officers listened to the report impassively. One of them simply moved on with his plastic bags to continue his work. In a little while, another one stopped to listen, and the rest of them promptly left him there alone. However, the young man could not calm down. He told his story to this new man as if every detail had another hundred details and every sentence needed a further explanation, as if with every explanation he were revealing earthshaking secrets while keeping silent about his own.<br>He was not cold, yet his whole body was shivering. The plainclothes officer offered him a blanket, go on, wrap it around yourself, but he rejected it with an irritated gesture, as if the condition of his body, an impending cold or the awkward and embarrassing shivering, did not interest him in the least. He probably had some kind of nervous fever, a phenomenon not unfamiliar to law-enforcement people. Neither could he be certain of the impression he was making. He felt he was not making a good one, which in turn compelled him to present everything in ever greater detail. This last policeman, however, regarded him with delight, with an enthusiasm bordering on love, as he observed the agitation in the young man&#x2019;s facial features, body, and individual limbs, and his ceaseless gesticulation, wondering whether to think of him as choleric or ascetic, as someone with above-average intelligence and sensitivity or simply as a city idiot interested only in himself.<br>As a person so starved for speech that he could not stop before tomorrow. As one to whom nothing ever happened but who now was becoming tangled in a suddenly arrived great adventure; as one entrusted with nothing less than the secrets of the universe.<br>He elicited pity and some worry. In the end he could talk only to this one police officer, but he completely enthralled him with his feverish words, his vehement but disciplined and therefore fractured gestures, and his mental makeup that defied classification.<br>After methodically scanning the various surfaces and points of the young man&#x2019;s body and attire, and because the observed exterior seemed so average that even its social situation would prove hard to determine, this detective asked the young man which university he was attending and what he was studying, slyly adding that he asked not officially but only as a private person. Theoretically he had no right to pose such a question, but he knew from experience that sometimes a few innocent words will stanch sickly and senseless gushing. The death of strangers can cause real hysteria even in the most endomorphic persons. At the same time he did not mean the question to be a formal one; he was interested to see how the young man might be steered by such an innocent query, how far he might be led from his self-admiration, or perhaps how he could be trapped; how tractable he was. Although he was one of those well-trained detectives who usually avoided being misled by an unexpectedly deep impression or a labyrinthine imagination, the plainclothesman could not resist the experiment, at least to the extent of asking the provocative question.<br>However, whether with this or some other approach, whether in the first hours of an investigation&#x2014;in police parlance the &#x201c;loop&#x201d; questions, or &#x201c;first foray&#x201d;&#x2014;or at its peak, when the results somehow hang together however precariously, it was impossible not to lose some equilibrium. Here and there, he set little traps. Because detectives like him consider their own ideas preferable to the general criminal procedures used by their less daring colleagues. They were more creative, though their methods were sometimes high-handed. In one professional idiom, they preferred heuristic means to syllogistic ones, and, being guided by the former, they sometimes violated the law.<br>Under the influence of the compassionless investigation, the young man interrupted his report to answer; he is studying philosophy and psychology, he replied, taken aback. And while he answered, he wondered what the police official was observing in him or what conclusions he had reached.<br>I should have thought, said the detective impassively.<br>What was he looking at on his neck, or what did he notice on his T-shirt, and now on his sweat suit.<br>All these thoughts stemmed the flood of words. As if realizing that nobody was interested in what he was reporting. Not only the others, but this detective too was considering the details on a different level, in another dimension. He was not busy with the reporter; he was not listening to the report.<br>For quite some time, he had gone running in tight pants, yellow or red, and the detective continued his investigation by looking at his thighs and loins.<br>Which was uncouth, and cut him to the quick, so that he caught himself and finally noticed the person standing before him in this bare park at dawn, snowflakes falling peacefully around them. He noticed the detective&#x2019;s lips, eyes, the exceptionally thick, highly arched eyebrows, and everything he had been seeing until now: the forehead, the insanely curly hair, the calm disposition. A man who looked at him penetratingly, almost woefully, as if he knew everything about him. As if to take account, individually, retroactively and in advance, of all his most hidden secrets and even to offer empathy. In fact, the amused detective was merely recalling what he had read in some silly magazine, sitting in the dentist&#x2019;s waiting room a few days earlier, namely that in Germany every year about seventeen thousand students enroll for studies in philosophy and twenty-two thousand in psychology. This would mean that during a whole generation more than a million people would be busy with the mechanics of the spirit and the soul, a big number indeed, though the number of people dealing in commerce, finance, and military matters is several times larger.<br>Sensing the detective&#x2019;s disesteem, his underestimation of scientific interest, the young man fell silent, though his wretched body kept shivering in his damp sweat suit.<br>With which he made himself vulnerable.<br>And in the sudden silence the policeman, who may have been about ten years older than the young man and had a la...</p><h2>Man-Kzin Wars IV</h2><p>The war for human survival continues against the felinoid invaders from the planet Kzin</p><p></p><h2>Fallen Dragon</h2><p>When his platoon is sent to a distant planet to stop a rebellion, Lawrence, determined to escape the constraints of the merciless and exploitative military, decides to steal their legendary gemstone, the Fallen Dragon, to get the money he needs, but he soon discovers that the gem is not what it seems, in a thrilling new adventure from the best-selling author of The Reality Dysfunction. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Peter F. Hamilton&#39;s many novels include Fallen Dragon, Judas Unchained, and the bestselling Night&#39;s Dawn trilogy, The Reality Dysfunction, The Neutronium Alchemist, and The Naked God. He is also the author of A Second Chance at Eden, a novella and six short stories set in the same brilliantly realized universe.This hefty novel of interstellar war and alien contact in the 25th century, a sort of Starship Troopers as if written by Charles Dickens, ranks as one of Hamilton's best. Though he's a mercenary for the Zantiu-Braun corporation, which gets its profits by periodically looting old interstellar colonies, Lawrence Newton has his eye on picking up a treasure trove of alien technology not on his employer's approved list of loot. When the Zantiu-Braun Third Fleet descends on the planet Thrallspring, the invaders unexpectedly find the inhabitants, who have access to some of that lost alien technology, prepared to fight back. After several hundred pages of well-depicted action and intrigue, the technology of the "dragons" makes the war superfluous, a definite victory for all opponents of the corporate pirates. It also makes it possible for Newton himself to travel in both time and space, and to put right the mishandling of a youthful love affair that forced him into exile in the first place. Ignoring conventional wisdom about expository lumps, flashbacks and viewpoint shifts, Hamilton (The Reality Dysfunction) nicely develops character while he also does some fine world building that's as good as it gets in space opera short of Lois McMaster Bujold. Despite the somewhat uneven pacing, the book is undeniably a page-turner and should provide many absorbing hours for the author's existing readers as well as a salutary introduction to a major SF author for a new audience.

Acclaimed by some as an instructive moral tale, it has been denounced by others for its implicit immorality. After having his portrait painted, Dorian Gray is captivated by his own beauty. Tempted by his world-weary friend, the decadent Lord Henry Wotton, he wished to stay young forever and pledges his very soul to keep his good looks. As Dorian's slide into crime and cruelty progresses, he stays magically youthful, while his beautiful portrait changes, revealing the hideous corruption of moral decay.<br> Set in <em>fin-de-si�cle</em> London, the novel traces a path from the studio of painter Basil Howard to the opium dens of the East End. The text of this edition is derived from the <em>Oxford English Texts</em>, which prints a critically established version of the first book edition of 1891. Also included is a new, fuller introduction, which considers the difference between the 1890 and 1891 texts, Wilde's range of sources, significant critical approaches to the novel and its reputation since 1891, full explanatory notes that identify Wilde's sources, and an up-to-date-bibliography.<br></p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Black Profiles in Courage: A Legacy of African-American Achievement</h2><p>Recounts inspirational stories of influential African Americans, such as Crispus Attucks, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Dr. Charles Drew, Duke Ellington, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks, and others. 150,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>With all the flair of his last-second game-winning sky hooks, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar delivers a well-written and important collection highlighting the lives of America's greatest black heroes. Taking his title cue from John Kennedy's <i>Profiles in Courage</i>, Abdul-Jabbar brings to life the exploits of a wide variety of African Americans, including Estevanico, a Moorish slave who discovered Arizona and New Mexico; Cinque, a kidnapped African slave who led a mutiny aboard the slave ship <i>Amistad</i> and later won his freedom in the U.S.; and Harriet Tubman, who brought hundreds of slaves to freedom on the Underground Railroad.<p> In a time when the media beams negative images of African Americans around the world, <i>Black Profiles in Courage</i> is indispensable for young adults of other races as well as African-American youth, showing that attributes like courage are not coded by color. For those young blacks who feel distant from America because of racism, books like this are a small but potent antidote against prejudice, reminding them of the important contributions African Americans have made to their country. <i>--Eugene Holley, Jr.</i></p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar retired from basketball in 1989.

In this volume, Meek is shown is his roles as pioneer, sheriff, U. S. Marshall, even legislator--Citizen Joe. Through Meek&#39;s pungent recollections, his engaging memoir also becomes an important history of Oregon&#39;s turbulent formative years--the struggles of the missionaries, the other early settlers, the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, and the Indians that shaped a territory and finally a state.</p><p></p><h2>The Enduring Hills</h2><p>Originally published in 1950, The Enduring Hills was Janice Holt Giles&#39;s first novel. It is based in part on her own courtship and introduction to the Kentucky mountain country. Here, Giles introduces Hod and Mary Pierce and begins her Appalachian trilogy. Hod Pierce, a boy not unlike Henry Giles, who grows up on Piney Ridge, where generations of Pierces have made a living from the stubborn soil. Hod loves his people and the land but longs also for wider horizons, for more education, and for the freedom he imagines can be found in the outside world. It takes World War II to carry Hod away from the Ridge and out into the great world, and it is a long time before he comes back. After the war is over, Hod settles into marriage and a factory job in the city. Finally it is Mary, his city-bred wife, who sees at last that to Hod, Piney Ridge will always be home. In her preface to the second edition, Mrs. Giles wrote, &#34;I believe [the story] is timeless and as the hand</p><p></p><h2>Understanding Geometry</h2><p>The successful completion of this colorful 272-page book will virtually guarantee a student's success in high school geometry. Although the geometric concepts of perimeter, area, and volume are taught piecemeal from elementary school through middle school, too many students enter high school without the skills and knowledge to succeed in high school geometry. Unfortunately, middle school students receive very little education on the properties of parallelograms and the tools needed to succeed at doing geometric proofs. The result is a high number of students who struggle with high school geometry and standardized testing. Geometry is a fundamental subject in high school standardized testing.<br><br>This book teaches students an understanding of the reasoning behind the properties taught in geometry&#x2013;instead of merely asking them to memorize them. Students are also taught the basics of geometric proofs and coordinate geometry in a way middle school students can understand. A glossary of terms that every student must master is included. This book can be used as a classroom textbook in Grades 7, 8, or 9 (usually over a two-year period). In many high schools this book can also be used as a one-year high school geometry course. This book follows the National Math Standards in mathematics but it goes further.</p><p></p><h2>Catholicism and American Freedom: A History</h2><p>Explores the history of the Catholic Church in the political and intellectual development of the United States, discussing its impact on policies regarding slavery, public education, contraception, and the economy.</p><p><b>John T. McGreevy</b> is the John A. O'Brien Associate Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame. He lives in South Bend, Indiana. His previous book, <i>Parish Boundaries</i>, won the John Gilmary Shea Prize of the American Catholic Historical Association.The interplay between the American Catholic Church and the United States has long been a source of tension for both church and state. McGreevy, an associate professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, examines the relationship between the two, beginning with the Eliot School Rebellion in Boston in 1859 and extending into the present day, when questions about abortion and human life dominate the church's engagement with American political life. The author begins by exploring efforts by some Catholics to counter the Protestant brand of Christianity being taught in the nation's public schools in the antebellum period, pointing out the sharp division that existed between Protestants and Catholics in the 19th century. He also discusses how Catholics dealt with slavery, then presents the church's stands on behalf of human life, most notably concerning abortion, a debate preceded and affected by an earlier battle over birth control. McGreevy's final chapter combines a discussion of the proposed "consistent life ethic" linking abortion, poverty, the arms race and the death penalty with a sparse treatment of the church's recent sexual abuse crisis. The author sees the scandal as further evidence of a fragile institution trying to distinguish "permanent truths from contingent applications." McGreevy's work is largely academic, and is presented in such a way that it will be of more interest to scholarly readers than ordinary Catholics. Still, it should be a valuable resource for students of modern church history. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>AMERICA&#39;S TEST KITCHEN</h2><p>[ The Best of America&#39;s Test Kitchen: The Year&#39;s Best Recipes, Equipment Reviews, and Tastings (2015) America&#39;s Test Kitchen ( Author ) ] { Hardcover } 2014</p><p></p><h2>No Better Place to Die: The Battle of Stones River</h2><p>Uses excerpts from the letters, diaries, and memoirs of the combatants to recreate the Tennessee battle, and assesses its influence on the outcome of the Civil War</p><p>Peter Cozzens meticulously traces the chain of events as the Army of the Cumberland and the Army of Tennessee meet in Middle Tennessee on New Year&#39;s Eve 1862 in one of the bloodiest encounters of the Civil War.Peter Cozzens, author of several acclaimed Civil War campaign studies, is an independent scholar and Foreign Service officer with the U.S. Department of State.</p><h2>Every Child Needs a Praying Mom</h2><p>What principles enabled the concerned mom of two junior high school students to move from deciding she needed to pray for her kids at school to becoming the founder of a worldwide prayer movement called Moms In Touch International? Fern Nichols is a passionate believer in the power of prayer. She knows that a regular habit of prayer can change things--can bring home wayward children, heal broken marriages, and provide answers to desperate situations. Prayer can also bring a new kind of peace and contentment no matter what hardships or disappointments we face. But most important, Fern knows that through prayer we can experience, firsthand, an ever-increasing intimacy with God. In Every Child Needs a Praying Mom, Fern Nichols now shares how she has taught women to pray in a way that changes their lives and the lives of those they love. She teaches the principles and practices that will not only revolutionize the way people think about prayer, but the way they do pray, leading them into a deeper intimacy with Jesus, who is always interceding on our behalf. Sparkling with real life stories of God at work in the lives of praying moms, Fern introduces us to the four prayers that are the foundation of the Moms In Touch approach to prayer: Praise--Praying according to the attributes of God; Confession--Breaking strongholds; Thanksgiving--Expressing a grateful heart; Intercession--Standing in the gap with Jesus. What transforms these well-known elements of prayer into such a powerful force in Moms In Touch International? Fern Nichols introduces a way of praying that energizes, creates an appetite for intimacy with God, overcomes spiritual paralysis, eliminates fear, unveils the heart and character of God and transforms the pray-er&#x2019;s life and perspective. She teaches how to pray effectively with others, how to prepare for the spiritual battles that swirl when prayer is on the move, how to persist in prayer in the face of hopelessness and despair, and how to use Scripture for effective prayer. Changing Your World through Prayer will do just that. God hears. God acts. God moves. God works.</p><p><p>Fern Nichols, married to Rle Nichols, is the mother of four married children and eight grandchildren.&nbsp; &nbsp;She is a former elementary teacher and the founder of Moms in Prayer International&#x2122;, a prayer movement that has touched thousands of women throughout the world.

There is also a chapter on the effects of this "addition" to Scripture on the lives of those who were living during the time that it was written. Indexes include: Scriptural Passages, Ancient Authors, Modern Authors, and a subject index. <br></p><p>Luke Timothy Johnson is the Robert W Woodruff Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta.I have written this book for those who want to understand the origin and shape of the New Testament writings but are unable to find a comprehensive introduction that is neither repellingly technical nor appallingly trivial. I have called it an interpretation rather than an introduction for the simple reason that most volumes going by the name of introduction are either handbooks devoted to the communication of information concerning a narrow range of scholarly issues or popularized versions of conventional scholarly wisdom for college students. In contrast to both, I have tried to provide a genuine interpretation of Christianity's earliest writings. By so doing I draw the reader into the most important critical questions concerning their understanding. In this sense, every interpretation is also an introduction. By no means is every introduction an interpretation. <p>The organization of this book, its argument, and the choice of topics have all been dictated by the desire to make these writings intelligible and alive for the contemporary reader who want to meet and understand them more than scholarly discussions of them. I have considered all the critical issues pertinent to the understanding of the writings, but I have gone beyond presenting a consensus of scholarly opinion. The reader will find in these pages a signal "reading" of the evidence from beginning to end---my own. My approach to the writings and the critical issues is independent. It is not, I think, idiosyncratic. I have learned more than I can ever credit to my teachers and to the reading of other scholars. But in this book I advance my own understanding of the New Testament in its origin, in each of its parts, and as a collection. Sometimes I agree with the majority of scholars; sometimes I disagree. I have tried to indicate the reasons for both. As in every attempt to deal with the whole of a subject within a reasonable space, much has been eliminated or abbreviated. More advanced readers should recognize in my sometimes elliptical remarks a thoughtful response to critical scholarship. </p><p>In order to keep my argument and presentation clean I have not used footnotes, nor do I refer to other scholars by name in the text. The reader will, I hope, forgive the inevitable air of omniscience that results. It seemed better to restrict reference to primary sources, above all the texts of the New Testament itself. Occasionally even these are so numerous as to make the detection of decent prose a problem. At the end of each chapter I have provided an annotated bibliography. Some entries support my presentation, others provide alternative points of view, still other give the reader additional resources for study. With very few exceptions I have included only literature in English, since the notes are meant to be an aid to the reader rather than a demonstration of learning. Given the rate of translation, not that much of great value is missing. I have also tried to refer to literature that is reasonably available. Translations of primary sources are acknowledged at the head of each bibliographical section. ---Preface to First Edition </p><p>The first edition of The Writings of the New Testament: An Interpretation appeared in 1986. The manuscript for that edition was completed in 1984. The bibliographies were fairly up-to-date but included only a few items from 1984. The contents of the books are therefore almost fifteen years old. Despite the usefulness of the first edition---it went through thirteen printings---it is clearly time for a new edition. </p><p>I have not changed the basic philosophy or design of the book. I have simply tried to update and improve it. The updating takes two basic forms. The first is the completely revised bibliographies. Some older items are eliminated; many more recent items are included. I have continued to use only English-language references for the reasons stated in the first edition. The second updating is found in two appendices. One deals with newer methods that have developed over the past fifteen years; it is only a sketch but it shows the general lines of development and its bibliography provides some starting points for reading. The other appendix deals with the question of the Historical Jesus. I explain why I continue to omit this topic from the body of the book, and try to indicate some of the critical questions and sources to consult. </p><p>The improvement of the book is found in the line-by-line editing. Every sentence has been assessed for accuracy and clarity. Many passages have been rewritten, some have been omitted, some added. The argument of each chapter remains the same, though I hope it is clearer and more accessible. All of the references have been checked and corrected. I have also added study questions at the end of each chapter to make the book an even better teaching tool. ---Preface to Revised Edition</p></p><h2>Julia&#39;s Kitchen Wisdom: Essential Techniques and Recipes from a Lifetime in Cooking (Random House Large Print)</h2><p>Julia Child has given us answers to these and other questions in the ten masterful volumes she has publishedover the past 40 years. But which book do you go to for which solution? Now, in this little volume, you can find the answers immediately.<br><br>Information is arranged according to subject matter, with ample cross-referencing. How are you going to cook that small rib steak you brought home? You'll be guided to the quick saute as the best and fstest way. And once you've masteree this recipe, you can apply the technique to chop, chicken, or fish, following Julia's careful guidelines.<br><br>And here is equally essential information about soups, vegetables, and eggs, and for baking breads and tarts. It's all waiting for you in this delicious, priceless, comforting compendium of Julia's kitchen wisdom.</p><p>What would you give to see the notes Julia Child keeps in her handwritten loose-leaf kitchen reference guide? Your wish is granted! This clever little volume was inspired by Child's notebook, compiled from her own "trials, remedies, and errors."<p> Organized by large category and technique, it's a very handy reference guide for anyone reasonably comfortable in the kitchen. Each section contains a master recipe followed by variations. The emphasis is on technique, so if you occasionally find yourself trying to remember at what temperature to best roast a duck, the best way to cook green beans and keep them green, or how to save your hollandaise, then this is the book for you. And what good is a reference guide without an index? As always, Child comes to our rescue with a fantastic, comprehensive index, 19 pages long for 107 pages of text, so we can find the answers to life's burning questions in a flash.</p><p> Part of what makes Julia Child such an icon is that she can describe a complicated dish, and in the next breath convince us to make it. Classic Chocolate Mousse, Sabayon, Scalloped Potatoes Savoyarde, and Butterflied Leg of Lamb sound manageable when they follow recipes for Roast Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, and Scrambled Eggs. And with Child's help, they are. "Quick, snappy answers" for both basic and complicated cooking questions make this a work we'll never outgrow. And if Julia can use a cheat sheet, so can we! Fans of Child will love that her personality shows through in comments like, "Don't crowd the pan... or you'll be sorry," and, to introduce her Basic Vinaigrette Dressing, "I use the proportions of a very dry martini." Eight pages of photos taken by her husband, Paul, including one of Child with the famous dancing goose, make this even more of a treasure.</p><p> If there is anyone qualified to offer kitchen wisdom, it must be Julia Child. After a lifetime of cooking and teaching, her knowledge is a perfect gift for fans, novices, or anyone responsible for putting dinner on the table every night. <i>--Leora Y.

The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really <i>is</i>.

Nine years later, <i>Toy Story</i> was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie&#x2019;s success&#x2014;and in the thirteen movies that followed&#x2014;was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:<br><br>� Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.<br>� If you don&#x2019;t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. <br>� It&#x2019;s not the manager&#x2019;s job to prevent risks.

It was long and skinny, like one of those things you&#x2019;d see in a comedy sketch about an old wealthy couple that sits down for dinner&#x2014;�one person at either end, a candelabra in the middle&#x2014;�and has to shout to make conversation. The table had been chosen by a designer Steve Jobs liked, and it was elegant, all right&#x2014;�but it impeded our work.<br><br>We&#x2019;d hold regular meetings about our movies around that table&#x2014;�thirty of us facing off in two long lines, often with more people seated along the walls&#x2014;�and everyone was so spread out that it was difficult to communicate. For those unlucky enough to be seated at the far ends, ideas didn&#x2019;t flow because it was nearly impossible to make eye contact without craning your neck. Moreover, because it was important that the director and producer of the film in question be able to hear what everyone was saying, they had to be placed at the center of the table. So did Pixar&#x2019;s creative leaders: John Lasseter, Pixar&#x2019;s creative officer, and me, and a handful of our most experienced directors, producers, and writers. To ensure that these people were always seated together, someone began making place cards. We might as well have been at a formal dinner party.<br><br>When it comes to creative inspiration, job titles and hierarchy are meaningless. That&#x2019;s what I believe. But unwittingly, we were allowing this table&#x2014;�and the resulting place card ritual&#x2014;�to send a different message. The closer you were seated to the middle of the table, it implied, the more important&#x2014;�the more central&#x2014;�you must be. And the farther away, the less likely you were to speak up&#x2014;�your distance from the heart of the conversation made participating feel intrusive. If the table was crowded, as it often was, still more people would sit in chairs around the edges of the room, creating yet a third tier of participants (those at the center of the table, those at the ends, and those not at the table at all). Without intending to, we&#x2019;d created an obstacle that discouraged people from jumping in.<br><br>Over the course of a decade, we held countless meetings around this table in this way&#x2014;�completely unaware of how doing so undermined our own core principles. Why were we blind to this? Because the seating arrangements and place cards were designed for the convenience of the leaders, including me. Sincerely believing that we were in an inclusive meeting, we saw nothing amiss because we didn&#x2019;t feel excluded. Those not sitting at the center of the table, meanwhile, saw quite clearly how it established a pecking order but presumed that we&#x2014;�the leaders&#x2014;�had intended that outcome. Who were they, then, to complain?<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until we happened to have a meeting in a smaller room with a square table that John and I realized what was wrong. Sitting around that table, the interplay was better, the exchange of ideas more free-�flowing, the eye contact automatic. Every person there, no matter their job title, felt free to speak up. This was not only what we wanted, it was a fundamental Pixar belief: Unhindered communication was key, no matter what your position. At our long, skinny table, comfortable in our middle seats, we had utterly failed to recognize that we were behaving contrary to that basic tenet. Over time, we&#x2019;d fallen into a trap. Even though we were conscious that a room&#x2019;s dynamics are critical to any good discussion, even though we believed that we were constantly on the lookout for problems, our vantage point blinded us to what was right before our eyes.<br><br>Emboldened by this new insight, I went to our facilities department. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care how you do it, but get that table out of there.&#x201d; I wanted something that could be arranged into a more intimate square, so people could address each other directly and not feel like they didn&#x2019;t matter. A few days later, as a critical meeting on an upcoming movie approached, our new table was installed, solving the problem.<br><br>Still, interestingly, there were remnants of that problem that did not immediately vanish just because we&#x2019;d solved it. For example, the next time I walked into West One, I saw the brand-�new table, arranged&#x2014;�as requested&#x2014;�in a more intimate square that made it possible for more people to interact at once. But the table was adorned with the same old place cards! While we&#x2019;d fixed the key problem that had made place cards seem necessary, the cards themselves had become a tradition that would continue until we specifically dismantled it. This wasn&#x2019;t as troubling an issue as the table itself, but it was something we had to address because cards implied hierarchy, and that was precisely what we were trying to avoid. When Andrew Stanton, one of our directors, entered the meeting room that morning, he grabbed several place cards and began randomly moving them around, narrating as he went. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need these anymore!&#x201d; he said in a way that everyone in the room grasped. Only then did we succeed in eliminating this ancillary problem.<br><br>This is the nature of management. Decisions are made, usually for good reasons, which in turn prompt other decisions. So when problems arise&#x2014;�and they always do&#x2014;�disentangling them is not as simple as correcting the original error. Often, finding a solution is a multi-�step endeavor. There is the problem you know you are trying to solve&#x2014;�think of that as an oak tree&#x2014;�and then there are all the other problems&#x2014;�think of these as saplings&#x2014;�that sprouted from the acorns that fell around it. And these problems remain after you cut the oak tree down.<br><br>Even after all these years, I&#x2019;m often surprised to find problems that have existed right in front of me, in plain sight. For me, the key to solving these problems is finding ways to see what&#x2019;s working and what isn&#x2019;t, which sounds a lot simpler than it is. Pixar today is managed according to this principle, but in a way I&#x2019;ve been searching all my life for better ways of seeing. It began decades before Pixar even existed.<br><br>When I was a kid, I used to plunk myself down on the living room floor of my family&#x2019;s modest Salt Lake City home a few minutes before 7 p.m. every Sunday and wait for Walt Disney. Specifically, I&#x2019;d wait for him to appear on our black-�and-�white RCA with its tiny 12-�inch screen. Even from a dozen feet away&#x2014;�the accepted wisdom at the time was that viewers should put one foot between them and the TV for every inch of screen&#x2014;�I was transfixed by what I saw.<br><br>Each week, Walt Disney himself opened the broadcast of The Wonderful World of Disney. Standing before me in suit and tie, like a kindly neighbor, he would demystify the Disney magic. He&#x2019;d explain the use of synchronized sound in Steamboat Willie or talk about the importance of music in Fantasia. He always went out of his way to give credit to his forebears, the men&#x2014;�and, at this point, they were all men&#x2014;�who&#x2019;d done the pioneering work upon which he was building his empire. He&#x2019;d introduce the television audience to trailblazers such as Max Fleischer, of Koko the Clown and Betty Boop fame, and Winsor McCay, who made Gertie the Dinosaur&#x2014;�the first animated film to feature a character that expressed emotion&#x2014;�in 1914. He&#x2019;d gather a group of his animators, colorists, and storyboard artists to explain how they made Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck come to life. Each week, Disney created a made-�up world, used cutting-�edge technology to enable it, and then told us how he&#x2019;d done it.<br><br>Walt Disney was one of my two boyhood idols. The other was Albert Einstein. To me, even at a young age, they represented the two poles of creativity. Disney was all about inventing the new. He brought things into being&#x2014;�both artistically and technologically&#x2014;�that did not exist before. Einstein, by contrast, was a master of explaining that which already was. I read every Einstein biography I could get my hands on as well as a little book he wrote on his theory of relativity. I loved how the concepts he developed forced people to change their approach to physics and matter, to view the universe from a different perspective. Wild-�haired and iconic, Einstein dared to bend the implications of what we thought we knew. He solved the biggest puzzles of all and, in doing so, changed our understanding of reality.<br><br>Both Einstein and Disney inspired me, but Disney affected me more because of his weekly visits to my family&#x2019;s living room. &#x201c;When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are,&#x201d; his TV show&#x2019;s theme song would announce as a baritone-�voiced narrator promised: &#x201c;Each week, as you enter this timeless land, one of these many worlds will open to you . . . .&#x201d; Then the narrator would tick them off: Frontierland (&#x201c;tall tales and true from the legendary past&#x201d;), Tomorrowland (&#x201c;the promise of things to come&#x201d;), Adventureland (&#x201c;the wonder world of nature&#x2019;s own realm&#x201d;), and Fantasyland (&#x201c;the happiest kingdom of them all&#x201d;). I loved the idea that animation could take me places I&#x2019;d never been. But the land I most wanted to learn about was the one occupied by the innovators at Disney who made these animated films.<br><br>Between 1950 and 1955, Disney made three movies we consider classics today: Cinderella, Peter Pan, and Lady and the Tramp. More than half a century later, we all remember the glass slipper, the Island of Lost Boys, and that scene where the cocker spaniel and the mutt slurp spaghetti. But few grasp how technically sophisticated these movies were. Disney&#x2019;s animators were at the forefront of applied technology; instead of merely using existing methods, they were inventing ones of their own. They had to develop the tools to perfect sound and color, to use blue screen matting and multi-�plane cameras and xerography. Every time some technological breakthrough occurred, Walt Disney incorporated it and then talked about it on his show in a way that highlighted the relationship between technology and art. I was too young to realize such a synergy was groundbreaking. To me, it just made sense that they belonged together.<br><br>Watching Disney one Sunday evening in April of 1956, I experienced something that would define my professional life. What exactly it was is difficult to describe except to say that I felt something fall into place inside my head. That night&#x2019;s episode was called &#x201c;Where Do the Stories Come From?&#x201d; and Disney kicked it off by praising his animators&#x2019; knack for turning everyday occurrences into cartoons. That night, though, it wasn&#x2019;t Disney&#x2019;s explanation that pulled me in but what was happening on the screen as he spoke. An artist was drawing Donald Duck, giving him a jaunty costume and a bouquet of flowers and a box of candy with which to woo Daisy. Then, as the artist&#x2019;s pencil moved around the page, Donald came to life, putting up his dukes to square off with the pencil lead, then raising his chin to allow the artist to give him a bow tie.<br><br>The definition of superb animation is that each character on the screen makes you believe it is a thinking being. Whether it&#x2019;s a T-�Rex or a slinky dog or a desk lamp, if viewers sense not just movement but intention&#x2014;�or, put another way, emotion&#x2014;�then the animator has done his or her job. It&#x2019;s not just lines on paper anymore; it&#x2019;s a living, feeling entity. This is what I experienced that night, for the first time, as I watched Donald leap off the page. The transformation from a static line drawing to a fully dimensional, animated image was sleight of hand, nothing more, but the mystery of how it was done&#x2014;�not just the technical process but the way the art was imbued with such emotion&#x2014;�was the most interesting problem I&#x2019;d ever considered. I wanted to climb through the TV screen and be part of this world.<br><br>The mid-�1950s and early 1960s were, of course, a time of great prosperity and industry in the United States. Growing up in Utah in a tight-�knit Mormon community, my four younger brothers and sisters and I felt that anything was possible. Because the adults we knew had all lived through the Depression, World War II, and then the Korean War, this period felt to them like the calm after a thunderstorm.<br><br>I remember the optimistic energy&#x2014;�an eagerness to move forward that was enabled and supported by a wealth of emerging technologies. It was boom time in America, with manufacturing and home construction at an all-�time high. Banks were offering loans and credit, which meant more and more people could own a new TV, house, or Cadillac. There were amazing new appliances like disposals that ate your garbage and machines that washed your dishes, although I certainly did my share of cleaning them by hand. The first organ transplants were performed in 1954; the first polio vaccine came a year later; in 1956, the term artificial intelligence entered the lexicon. The future, it seemed, was already here.<br><br>Then, when I was twelve, the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite&#x2014;�Sputnik 1&#x2014;�into earth&#x2019;s orbit. This was huge news, not just in the scientific and political realms but in my sixth grade classroom at school, where the morning routine was interrupted by a visit from the principal, whose grim expression told us that our lives had changed forever. Since we&#x2019;d been taught that the Communists were the enemy and that nuclear war could be waged at the touch of a button, the fact that they&#x2019;d beaten us into space seemed pretty scary&#x2014;proof that they had the upper hand.<br><br>The United States government&#x2019;s response to being bested was to create something called ARPA, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Though it was housed within the Defense Department, its mission was ostensibly peaceful: to support scientific researchers in America&#x2019;s universities in the hopes of preventing what it termed &#x201c;technological surprise.&#x201d; By sponsoring our best minds, the architects of ARPA believed, we&#x2019;d come up with better answers. Looking back, I still admire that enlightened reaction to a serious threat: We&#x2019;ll just have to get smarter. ARPA would have a profound effect on America, leading directly to the computer revolution and the Internet, among countless other innovations. There was a sense that big things were happening in America, with much more to come. Life was full of possibility.<br><br>Still, while my family was middle-�class, our outlook was shaped by my father&#x2019;s upbringing. Not that he talked about it much. Earl Catmull, the son of an Idaho dirt farmer, was one of fourteen kids, five of whom had died as infants. His mother, raised by Mormon pioneers who made a meager living panning for gold in the Snake River in Idaho, didn&#x2019;t attend school until she was 11. My father was the first in his family ever to go to college, paying his own way by working several jobs. During my childhood, he taught math during the school year and built houses during the summers. He built our house from the ground up. While he never explicitly said that education was paramount, my siblings and I all knew we were expected to study hard and go to college.</p><h2>You Can Train Your Horse to Do Anything!: On Target Training Clicker Training and Beyond</h2><p>On Target Training is a revolutionary reward reinforcement training method specially developed for horses by animal training experts Shawna and Vinton Karrasch.</p><p>If you have ever wished you could get your horse to consistently perform to the best of his ability, On Target Training is for you.

The stick, long and thin, was made of plastic. It hadn&#x2019;t hurt much the first time it touched my skin. But that was over an hour and a hundred flails ago. Now every swat felt like I was being smacked by a baseball bat. <br>A bat spiked with 20-penny nails. <br>&#x201c;You will confess!&#x201d; shouted my tormentor. &#x201c;You will fall on your knees before the one true God, blessed be His holy name.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Screw yourself,&#x201d; I said between my gritted teeth. <br> <i>Thwack.</i> <br>&#x201c;Ugh.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Confess! Or we will beat salvation into you!&#x201d; <br>I was seeing a part of Saudi Arabia that the Tourist Board doesn&#x2019;t advertise. You can call it the belly of the beast; to my mind, it&#x2019;s a much lower part of the anatomy. <br>&#x201c;Do you confess?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; <br> <i>Thwack. Thwack.</i> <br>Under intense international pressure a few years back, the Saudi government reformed its prison system. The new rules give certain guidelines for &#x201c;corrective measures&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, beating the crap out of a prisoner. The &#x201c;corrector&#x201d; must hold a book under his arm while administering lashes. The idea was to keep the torturer from raising the cane too high over his head. <br>I can attest that the letter of the law was observed in this case. I even know the title of the book, which was an illustrated comic collection entitled <i>Brave Men in Saudi History.</i> The book, four pages long (two of them were blank), was duct-taped to his underarm. <br> <i>Thwack. Thaaaaa-WACK!</i> <br>Somewhere around whack number sixty-eight, I had begun fantasizing about what I would do to the bastard with the stick. My thoughts were very creative, and in no case would the stick have been recognizable as a stick when I was done. <br>By now, though, I was beyond any sort of fantasy. I was, as the football play-by-play analysts put it, grinding it out. I just hoped the end of the game wasn&#x2019;t going to be signaled by a gun. <br>The Apaches, among other Native American tribes, have an especially useful mechanism for dealing with intense pain. I adopted it now, focusing my concentration on a point just outside my body. As the beatings continued, my mind stepped away and observed the scene. <br>This got me through another thirty or forty lashes. Finally the pain overwhelmed my body and I blacked out. Oblivion was a welcome reprieve, but it didn&#x2019;t last long. I came to only a few minutes later, as I was being dragged along a dank and dark cement corridor. <br>I have no idea why the corridor was dank&#x2014;the prison I was in was located at the edge of the Saudi desert, which has to be one of the driest places on earth. But dank it was. Moss, crud, and slime water blended into a horrendously smelling m�lange between the inlaid stones of the floor. I tried not to breathe. <br>I&#x2019;m far from a connoisseur, but I think I can say with some authority that Saudi jails are among the worst in the world. It doesn&#x2019;t even take that much to get into them. The surest way is by opposing the government or insulting the royal family, but you can get there with much lesser offenses if you know what you&#x2019;re doing. Drink a beer in your yard or drive a car with a woman who&#x2019;s not your wife&#x2014;supposed outrages to Islam&#x2014;and you will land there in a flash, even if you&#x2019;re a foreigner. Even random victims of crime who had the audacity to file police reports have found themselves guests of the state. <br>They were lying, you see. Because the Kingdom is PERFECT, and thus there is no crime, and anyone who says different is a slanderer who deserves to lose his tongue. <br>Being a traditionalist, I had chosen an oldie but a goldie to ensure my incarceration: I had insulted the Prophet and the Kingdom by proselytizing a vermin religion. <br>Said religion being Coptic Hinduism, which I had invented solely for the purpose of running afoul of the authorities. <br>Not that Coptic Hinduism preaches violence or anything remotely touching on the state or other religions. It borrows freely from all pantheons and pathways, seeking peaceful coexistence with all. We&#x2019;re not much on sacraments, and the heavy burden of conversion is best left to those of other beliefs. In fact, the most definite (and important) thing you can say about it, at least in the context of Saudi Arabia, is that it is not Islam, and therefore fit for repression. <br>The two guards dragging me to my cell were kindly fellows, and they tried cheering me up along the way by shouting various slogans in Arabic. <br> <i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a blessed fellow!&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be very popular in jail!&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;Now you will have a real chance to pray.&#x201d;</i> <br>My Arabic is mostly of use in brothels and street fights, so maybe my translation is a little soft. I will say that the others in my cell, all twelve of them, welcomed me with open arms and hard feet as I was hurled into the tiny space. <br>Walled by solid concrete on three sides, the room was roughly eight by six feet and smelled of sweat and human excrement. I curled myself into a corner at the back, hoping to be left alone. <br>Unfortunately, one of my fellow inmates had deputized himself as the Welcome Wagon. As he bent over me, a shiv appeared in his hand and he took a swipe at my face. <br>Coptic Hinduism has very strong precepts against having your face cut up and eyeballs gouged out. It has been heavily influenced by what many readers will recall as the Rogue Warrior&#x2019;s First Commandment: <br> <i>Do unto others before they do unto you.</i> <br>I decided that this was a good time to do some preaching. My opening text was a fist to the nether regions of my new congregant. This was followed by a fist to the throat. <br>The convict was impressed. He had never before encountered the spiritual depth of Coptic Hinduism. <br>Still, he was firm in his own primitive convictions, and pressed forward in his attempt to make a blood sacrifice to his gods. While I wanted nothing to do with such primitive religious practices, my retreat was cut off by the thick and immovable wall behind me. <br>He cut a halo across my forehead. I decided to return the favor by encouraging him to kneel and reflect on the holy light of the universe. Given that he was clearly devout, all he needed was a little push. <br>Or shove. <br>I sent him sprawling against the nearby wall. The others were looking on anxiously, perhaps hoping for their chance at conversion as well. So I leapt up, grabbed the little knife that had fallen from my convert&#x2019;s hand, and baptized him in the name of the Rogue, the Warrior, and the decidedly Unfriendly Ghost. <br>Duly impressed, the others backed away. <br>Exhausted by my spiritual experience, I dragged myself to the corner of the cell. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>You may very well be wondering what I was doing in Saudi Arabia in the first place. <br>The truth was I was here to find another American, Garrett Taylor. Garrett was the son of a friend of mine; he&#x2019;d gotten into a bit of trouble in the Kingdom Oil Built a few days before. I&#x2019;d heard that he was currently a guest at this esteemed Saudi institution. I had therefore posed rather ostentatiously as a preacher in hopes of meeting him. <br>Be careful what you wish for. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Not long after the blood stopped flowing from the neck of my new convert, a series of loud shouts announced the approach of the guards. We were ordered to clear the cell. I got up, hiding my shiv in the waistband of my pants. My knees were creaking and my spine felt as if it had been removed from my body and rearranged in a random pattern. Being last made me a target for the guards, who proceeded to give me a series of gentle love taps as a reward. <br>I thought they were coming to investigate the ruckus, but they made no move to do so beyond kicking over the limp body of my follower. I kept my head low and eyes peeled as I stumbled down the hall. When we came to the end of the corridor, we took a turn right and made our way up a set of concrete steps. Two guards behind me very kindly assisted my progress with a few kicks; otherwise I was left alone. <br>We were led to the courtyard behind the building. Stumbling, I took my place at the end of a line of prisoners who were kneeling in the direction of Mecca. I&#x2019;m not very big on praying, especially to Allah; a guard watching the line helped me into position with a punch between my shoulder blades; I put my head down and caught my breath as a loudspeaker began barking the call to prayers. <br>A few phrases into the proceeding, I recovered enough to raise my head slightly and look around for Garrett. There were maybe a hundred inmates in our little corner of paradise; none looked even remotely like the man I&#x2019;d come to rescue. <br>Prayers over, the inmates were allowed to walk for a few minutes before being led to dinner. I mingled silently. The courtyard was about twenty by fifty feet&#x2014;spacious for a Saudi jail&#x2014;and bounded by a high chain-link fence topped by barbed wire. There was another fence a short distance away, with another courtyard on the other side of that. <br>I circled around, mumbling to myself in a combination of random street Arabic and the occasional French and English. Anyone who heard me would think I was deranged&#x2014;all in all, not a bad assumption, actually. <br>He didn&#x2019;t seem to be in our courtyard. I sidled next to the fence and slid down to my haunches. <br>&#x201c;Garrett?&#x201d; I asked, raising my voice loud enough to be heard in the neighboring yard. None of the men close to the fence looked anything like him. <br>&#x201c;Garrett?&#x201d; <br>Some of my cellmates had gathered nearby and started talking loudly. I couldn&#x2019;t make out what they were saying, but the glances they threw me convinced me I better pay some attention to them. I was just about to when someone pressed against the fence behind me. <br>&#x201c;You? What are you doing here?&#x201d; said a voice in perfectly enunciated English. <br>I turned and looked through the fence. A young man who looked remarkably like my old shipmate was staring through the chain links.

A mysterious late-night visitor argues with her aloof father, Colonel de Luce, behind closed doors. And in the early morning Flavia finds a red-headed stranger lying in the cucumber patch and watches him take his dying breath. For Flavia, the summer begins in earnest when murder comes to Buckshaw: &#x201c; <i>I wish I could say I was afraid, but I wasn&#x2019;t. Quite the contrary. This was by far the most interesting thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life.&#x201d;</i> <br> <br>Did the stranger die of poisoning? There <i>was </i>a piece missing from Mrs. Mullet&#x2019;s custard pie, and none of the de Luces would have dared to eat the awful thing. Or could he have been killed by the family&#x2019;s loyal handyman, Dogger&#x2026; or by the Colonel himself! At that moment, Flavia commits herself to solving the crime &#x2014; even if it means keeping information from the village police, in order to protect her family. But then her father confesses to the crime, for the same reason, and it&#x2019;s up to Flavia to free him of suspicion. Only she has the ingenuity to follow the clues that reveal the victim&#x2019;s identity, and a conspiracy that reaches back into the de Luces&#x2019; murky past. <br> <br>A thoroughly entertaining romp of a novel, <b>The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie</b> is inventive and quick-witted, with tongue-in-cheek humour that transcends the macabre seriousness of its subject. <br> <br> <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>In his wickedly brilliant first novel, Debut Dagger Award winner Alan Bradley introduces one of the most singular and engaging heroines in recent fiction: eleven-year-old Flavia de Luce, an aspiring chemist with a passion for poison.

Now Flavia is armed with more than enough knowledge to tie two distant deaths together, to examine new suspects, and begin a search that will lead her all the way to the King of England himself.

Go ahead, take a bite. <i>--Lauren Nemroff</i> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Alan Bradley</strong> <br> <br> <b>Question:</b> With the publication of <i>The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie</i>, you&#x2019;ve become a 70-year-old-first time novelist. Have you always had a passion for writing, or is it more of a recent development? <br> <p><b>Alan Bradley:</b> Well, the Roman author Seneca once said something like this: &#x201c;Hang on to your youthful enthusiasms--you&#x2019;ll be able to use them better when you&#x2019;re older.&#x201d; So to put it briefly, I&#x2019;m taking his advice.</p> <p>I actually spent most of my life working on the technical side of television production, but would like to think that I&#x2019;ve always been a writer. I started writing a novel at age five, and have written articles for various publications all my life. It wasn&#x2019;t until my early retirement, though, that I started writing books. I published my memoir, <i>The Shoebox Bible</i>, in 2004, and then started working on a mystery about a reporter in England. It was during the writing of this story that I stumbled across Flavia de Luce, the main character in <i>Sweetness</i>.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Flavia certainly is an interesting character. How did you come up with such a forceful, precocious and entertaining personality?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> Flavia walked onto the page of another book I was writing, and simply hijacked the story. I was actually well into this other book--about three or four chapters--and as I introduced a main character, a detective, there was a point where he was required to go to a country house and interview this colonel.</p> <p>I got him up to the driveway and there was this girl sitting on a camp stool doing something with a notebook and a pencil and he stopped and asked her what she was doing and she said &#x201c;writing down license number plates&#x201c; and he said &#x201c;well there can't be many in such a place&#x201c; and she said, &#x201c;well I have yours, don&#x2019;t I? &#x201c; I came to a stop. I had no idea who this girl was and where she came from.</p> <p>She just materialized. I can't take any credit for Flavia at all. I&#x2019;ve never had a character who came that much to life. I&#x2019;ve had characters that tend to tell you what to do, but Flavia grabbed the controls on page one. She sprung full-blown with all of her attributes--her passion for poison, her father and his history--all in one package. It surprised me.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> There aren&#x2019;t many adult books that feature child narrators. Why did you want Flavia to be the voice of this novel?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> People probably wonder, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a 70-year-old-man doing writing about an 11-year-old-girl in 1950s England? &#x201c; And it&#x2019;s a fair question. To me, Flavia embodies that kind of hotly burning flame of our young years: that time of our lives when we&#x2019;re just starting out, when anything--absolutely anything!--is within our capabilities. </p> <p>I think the reason that she manifested herself as a young girl is that I realized that it would really be a lot of fun to have somebody who was virtually invisible in a village. And of course, we don&#x2019;t listen to what children say--they&#x2019;re always asking questions, and nobody pays the slightest attention or thinks for a minute that they&#x2019;re going to do anything with the information that they let slip. I wanted Flavia to take great advantage of that. I was also intrigued by the possibilities of dealing with an unreliable narrator; one whose motives were not always on the up-and-up.</p> <p>She is an amalgam of burning enthusiasm, curiosity, energy, youthful idealism, and frightening fearlessness. She&#x2019;s also a very real menace to anyone who thwarts her, but fortunately, they don&#x2019;t generally realize it. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> Like Flavia, you were also 11 years old in 1950. Is there anything autobiographical about her character?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> Somebody pointed out the fact that both Flavia and I lacked a parent. But I wasn&#x2019;t aware of this connection during the writing of the book. It simply didn&#x2019;t cross my mind. It is true that I grew up in a home with only one parent, and I was allowed to run pretty well free, to do the kinds of things I wanted. And I did have extremely intense interests then--things that you get focused on. When you&#x2019;re that age, you sometimes have a great enthusiasm that is very deep and very narrow, and that is something that has always intrigued me--that world of the 11-year-old that is so quickly lost.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your story evokes such a vivid setting. Had you spent much time in the British countryside before writing this book?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> My first trip to England didn&#x2019;t come until I went to London to receive the 2007 Debut Dagger Award, so I had never even stepped foot in the country at the time of writing <i>Sweetness</i>. But I have always loved England. My mother was born there. And I&#x2018;ve always felt I grew up in a very English household. I had always wanted to go and had dreamed for many years of doing so. </p> <p>When I finally made it there, the England that I was seeing with my eyes was quite unlike the England I had imagined, and yet it was the same. I realized that the differences were precisely those differences between real life, and the simulation of real life, that we create in our detective novels. So this was an opportunity to create on the page this England that had been in my head my whole life.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You have five more books lined up in this series, all coming from Delacorte Press. Will Flavia age as the series goes on?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> A bit, not very much. I think she&#x2019;s going to remain in the same age bracket. I don&#x2019;t really like the idea of Flavia as an older teenager. At her current age, she is such a concoction of contradictions. It's one of the things that I very much love about her. She's eleven but she has the wisdom of an adult. She knows everything about chemistry but nothing about family relationships. I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d be the same person if she were a few years older. She certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have access to the drawing rooms of the village.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Do you have a sense of what the next books in the series will be about?</p> <p><b>AB:</b> The second book, <i>The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag</i>, is finished, and I&#x2019;m working on the third book. I have a general idea of what&#x2019;s happening in each one of the books, because I wanted to focus on some bygone aspect of British life that was still there in the '50s but has now vanished. So we have postage stamps in the first one... The second book is about the travelling puppet shows on the village green. And one of them is about filmmaking--it sort of harks back to the days of the classic Ealing comedies with Alec Guinness and so forth.</p> <b>Q:</b> Not every author garners such immediate success with a first novel. After only completing 15 pages of <i>Sweetness</i>, you won the Dagger award and within 8 days had secured book deals in 3 countries. You&#x2019;ve since secured 19 countries. Enthusiasm continues to grow from every angle. How does it feel? <p></p> <p><b>AB:</b> It's like being in the glow of a fire. You hope you won't get burned. I&#x2019;m not sure how much I&#x2019;ve realized it yet. I guess I can say I&#x2018;m &#x201c;almost overwhelmed&#x201d;--I&#x2019;m not quite overwhelmed, but I&#x2019;m getting there. Every day has something new happening, and communications pouring in from people all over. The book has been receiving wonderful reviews and touching people. But Flavia has been touching something in people that generates a response from the heart, and the most often mentioned word in the reviews is love--how much people love Flavia and have taken her in as if she&#x2019;s a long-lost member of their family, which is certainly very, very gratifying.</p> <p>(Photo � Jeff Bassett)</p></p><h2>Mort (Discworld)</h2><p>GIFT QUALITY PAPERBACK - NEVER BEEN OPENED!

Miss Potter is starting to make a life for herself, both on her farm and in the villages of Far and Near Sawrey. She's acquired a herd of Herdwick sheep, is remodeling the farmhouse, and is slowly recovering from the death of her fianc�. Nefarious and curious events begin to happen: the body of a local shepherd is found at the base of a cliff; a pair of badgers is missing, presumably to be used in an illegal badger-baiting fight; and rich Lady Longford is putting forward her own candidate to teach in the Sawrey School. The animals (who can talk to one another) have been joined by the redoubtable Professor Galileo Newton Owl and the stalwart Bosworth Badger XVII, hotelier and genealogist of the badger clan. The plot moves swiftly and surely, with deft characterizations and comic charm, culminating in a rally of Big Folk and animals to save the innocent and punish the guilty. As in the first Cottage Tale, Albert has included research resources, recipes, a glossary, a map, an author's note, and a particularly helpful cast of characters. Teens will enjoy this small gem of a mystery revolving around the sweet Miss Potter, her neighbors, and the charming creatures she holds dear.<i>&#x2013;Jane Halsall, McHenry Public Library District, IL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p><b>Melba Pattillo Beals</b> is a journalist and member of the Little Rock Nine, a group of African-American students who were the first to integrate Central High in Little Rock, Arkansas.<b>Chapter One</b> <p> My grandmother India always said God had pointed a finger at our family, asking for just a bit more discipline, more praying, and more hard work because he had blessed us with good health and good brains. My mother was one of the first few blacks to integrate the University of Arkansas, graduating in 1954. Three years later, when Grandma discovered I would be one of the first blacks to attend Central High School, she said the nightmare that had surrounded my birth was proof positive that destiny had assigned me a special task. </p><p> First off, I was born on Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 1941. Mother says while she was giving birth to me, there was a big uproar, with the announcement that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. She remembers how astonished she was, and yet her focus was necessarily on the task at hand. There was trouble with my delivery because Mom was tiny and I was nine pounds. The doctor used forceps to deliver me and injured my scalp. A few days later, I fell ill with a massive infection. Mother took me to the white hospital, which reluctantly treated the families of black men who worked on the railroad. A doctor operated to save my life by inserting a drainage system beneath my scalp. </p><p> Twenty-four hours later I wasn't getting better. Whenever Mother sought help, neither nurses nor doctors would take her seriously enough to examine me. Instead, they said, "Just give it time." </p><p> Two days after my operation, my temperature soared to 106 and I started convulsing. Mother sent for the minister to give me the last rites, and relatives were gathering to say farewell. </p><p> That evening, while Grandmother sat in my hospital room, rocking me back and forth as she hummed her favorite hymn, "On the Battlefield for My Lord," Mother paced the floor weeping aloud in her despair. A black janitor who was sweeping the hallway asked why she was crying. She explained that I was dying because the infection in my head had grown worse. </p><p> The man extended his sympathy. As he turned to walk away, dragging his broom behind him, he mumbled that he guessed the Epsom salts hadn't worked after all. Mother ran after him asking what he meant. He explained that a couple of days before, he had been cleaning the operating room as they finished up with my surgery. He had heard the doctor tell the white nurse to irrigate my head with Epsom salts and warm water every two or three hours or I wouldn't make it. </p><p> Mother shouted the words "Epsom salts and water" as she raced down the hall, desperately searching for a nurse. The woman was indignant, saying, yes, come to think of it, the doctor had said something about Epsom salts. "But we don't coddle niggers," she growled. </p><p> Mother didn't talk back to the nurse. She knew Daddy's job was at stake. Instead, she sent for Epsom salts and began the treatment right away. Within two days, I was remarkably better. The minister went home, and the sisters from the church abandoned their death watch, declaring they had witnessed a miracle. </p><p> So fifteen years later, when I was selected to integrate Central High, Grandmother said, "Now you see, that's the reason God spared your life. You're supposed to carry this banner for our people." </p><p> </p><p> Black folks aren't born expecting segregation, prepared from day one to follow its confining rules. Nobody presents you with a handbook when you're teething and says, "Here's how you must behave as a second-class citizen." Instead, the humiliating expectations and traditions of segregation creep over you, slowly stealing a teaspoonful of your self-esteem each day. </p><p> By the time I was four years old, I was asking questions neither my mother nor grandmother cared to answer. "Why do the white people write <i>Colored</i> on all the ugly drinking fountains, the dingy restrooms, and the back of the buses? When will we get our turn to be in charge?" Grandma India would only say, "In God's time. Be patient, child, and tell God all about it." </p><p> I remember sitting on the dining room floor, writing letters to God in my Indian Head tablet. I painstakingly formed the alphabet just as Grandma had taught me to do in order to distract me from my asthma cough. I could do the multiplication table through ten and read and write simple sentences by the age of four as a result of all those long nights working with her. </p><p> When I was five, I had my first true bout with testing the harsh realities of segregation. My family -- Grandmother, Mother, Daddy, and my brother, Conrad, plus most of my aunts and uncles -- had gathered at Fair Park for a Fourth of July picnic. As usual we were separated from the white people, set apart in a wooded section away from the pool and the merry-go-round. While the grownups busied themselves setting up the meal, I made my escape, sneaking away to ride the merry-go-round. I had had my eye on one horse in particular, Prancer, the one I had dreamed about during all those months as I saved up the five pennies I needed to ride him. </p><p> I reached up to give the concessionaire my money. "There's no space for you here," the man said. But I pointed to Prancer's empty saddle. That's when he shouted at me and banged hard on the counter, spilling my coins on the ground. "You don't belong here, picaninny." I didn't know what that word meant. But his growling voice hurt my ears and made my knees shake. Angry faces glared at me as though I'd done something terribly wrong. Scurrying past the people waiting in line, I was so terrified that I didn't even take the time to pick up my precious pennies. At five I learned that there was to be no space for me on that merry-go-round no matter how many saddles stood empty. </p><p> </p><p> As a young child, my life was centered around the big, old, white wood-frame house at 1121 Cross Street that was my home. I lived there with my mother, Lois; her mother, my grandmother India; my father, Howell; and my brother, Conrad. Seven red cement stairs led up to the front door. A giant rubber plant stood just inside the front hallway next to tall mahogany bookcases that held the cherished volumes of Shakespeare, Chaucer, and Emily Dickinson, and of James Welden Johnson and Langston Hughes that Grandma and Mother loved so much. Some of the shelves held the textbooks Mother used for teaching seventh-grade English and for the night classes she took to get her master's degree. </p><p> Next came the living room with its tattered, overstuffed green velvet chair and matching couch. The half-moonshaped radio with brass knobs sat on a round mahogany table. Wine-colored leather chairs stood on either side. Great-grandma Ripley's clock and a copper horse that had belonged to Great-grandpa rested on the mantel over the fireplace. </p><p> The kitchen had a huge old-fashioned stove, a red chrome-trimmed breakfast table and chairs, bright yellow walls, and a linoleum floor with visible marks of wear and tear. Grandma could usually be found scrubbing it sparkling clean or baking cornbread, simmering collard greens, or preparing her special gourmet salmon souffl�. She had learned to cook some of her fancy dishes when she worked as a maid in white ladies' kitchens on Park Hill. </p><p> For as long as I can remember, I spent late afternoons with Grandma India in her garden, tending her four o'clock plants. I would stand beside her holding on to her skirt as she pulled the weeds or held the water hose. That's when we had our private talks. Once when I was six or so, I explained to her that I believed each human being was really only a spirit -- made by God, and that our bodies were like clothes hanging in the closet. I said I thought that one day I would be able to exchange my body for a white body, and then I could be in charge. </p><p> "Some of your thinking is right, child. We are not these bodies, we are spirits, God's ideas. But you must strive to be the best of what God made you. You don't want to be white, what you really want is to be free, and freedom is a state of mind." </p><p> "Yes, ma'am, but..." </p><p> "I hope you haven't told anyone else about spirits and bodies." She squeezed my hand. "Well, have you?" </p><p> "No, ma'am." </p><p> "Good. It's time you started keeping a diary so's you can write down these thoughts and share them with me sometimes, but mostly keep them to yourself and tell God." </p><p> The next time she went to town she brought me a pink diary that I could lock with a little key. Most evenings before sleeping, I looked forward to going to my bedroom to write to God. </p><p> My room was a place for my stuffed animals to live and a home for my huge brown Raggedy Ann doll, the one Grandma India made for me. It was a magical place where I daydreamed for hours as I listened to music or radio shows. There I could be whoever I wanted; I could be white -- I could be free. </p><p> My brother, Conrad's, bedroom was filled with strange trucks, glass jars of crawly bugs, and a wooden train Daddy made for him. Conrad spent lots of time counting marbles, putting puzzles together, and playing Monopoly. His room always seemed to be cluttered with pieces and parts of things, and Daddy would often march into Conrad's room and demand that he put all his toys and trucks back into the red wooden box they had built together. </p><p> Daddy worked for the Missouri Pacific Railroad as a hostler's helper. He would arrive home, his huge muscular body obviously tired from the physical labor of his job. Mother constantly reminded him that if he'd finish just one more course, he could graduate from college and have a professional job that paid more. But he resisted, saying he preferred to work outside in the fresh air, where he was free. He loved hunting and fishing and getting away to the wilds where nobody could bother him. It made Mother very angry that he wouldn't follow her advice. I worried they might do what my friend Carolyn's parents did -- get a divorce. </p><p> The dining room with its big oval table was the place we gathered each night for dinner and evening games. Daddy sat in the brown leather chair, reading his newspaper and working his crossword puzzles. Grandma entertained us with reading or checkers and chess so we wouldn't bother Mother as she studied for her...</p></p><h2>The American Drive-In: History and Folklore of the Drive-in Restaurant in American Car Culture</h2><p>Photographs and text depict the history of the folklore, architecture, and food of drive-in restaurants throughout the country</p><p>What ever happened to those cool drive-in restaurants, you know, the kind where you pulled into the parking lot and a carhop served you at the car window? In &#34;The American Drive-In,&#34; I tried to answer that question as I uncovered the history of car-service curb stands and the people that made them unique. It all began while I was traveling the highways of America: suddenly, I realized that regional specialties were disappearing. Home made food was becoming an oddity! Franchised fast food was taking over the task. So off I went, in search of the past, back to the days when carhops zipped around on roller skates, milkshakes were mixed with ice cream, and burgers sizzled with real ground beef! The memories I found are packed within this book. Enthusiasts will find everything there is to know about drive-ins, including photos of current and classic outfits, vintage postcards, menus, matchbooks, serving china, advertisements, neon signs, hamburger wrappers, and other colorful memorabilia. If you hunger for the nostalgia of dining-in-your-car, I urge you to revisit those glorious drive-in days with this tasty tribute to the drive-in restaurant!Michael Karl Witzel is an award-winning author and photographer.

She has encountered a terrifying beast called a lubbock, irritated a clan of small blue creatures, and wound up smack in the middle of an urgent search. The king and his daughter are desperate to find the lost, fabled Elfgift&#x2014;so desperate that they've even called in an intimidating sorceress named Sophie to help.

Although the Wizard Howl (this time in the guise of an irritating, lisping little boy); his feisty wife, Sophie; and Calcifer the fire demon play important roles, the story centers on Charmain, a bookish teen. When Charmain&#x2019;s great-uncle William, the king&#x2019;s Royal Wizard, falls deathly ill and is taken in by elves for a cure, Charmain is sent to look after William&#x2019;s house, which is, indeed, a house of many ways and rooms and magic within.

Since the mid-1800's, architects around the world have drawn inspiration from its ancient principles. <p>Nature on View presents a new chapter in that rich history with a look at 28 American homes and gardens located in various parts of the country. Together they demonstrate the current appeal and adaptability of timeless Japanese home design to Western lives and landscapes. </p><p>Shown here are country retreats, suburban homes, city apartments, guest houses, versatile teahouses, hilltop getaways and seaside residences. Ranging from luxurious to modest, some are brand new, while others are radical renovations of older homes. Each, however, incorporates basic principles of Japanese architecture in refreshing ways. </p><p>Jean Mahoney and Peggy Rao, authors of two earlier books that offer new ideas on living with Japanese antiques and artifacts, conduct this house and garden tour with their partner, photographer Toshiaki Sakuma. More than 180 full-color photographs focus on the fine craftsmanship, serene flexibility, decorative use of structural elements, and above all, the easy merger with the outdoors. </p><p>The accompanying text explains the origins of these appealing structures and introduces readers to the innovators involved. Some of the creators are professional landscapers, architects or designers; others are simply private citizens whose avocation became Japanese design. All share a heightened sensitivity to the natural environment.</p></p><p>New Yorkers Jean Mahoney and Peggy Rao met in Tokyo in the 1980's and launched their odyssey as chroniclers of imaginative East/West blends. Jean Mahoney is a graphic designer and a watercolorist with a varied background in advertising art direction. Peggy Rao is a journalist and a copywriter with extensive experience in publishing and advertising. <p>Specializing in homes and gardens, Toshiaki Sakuma is a well known Tokyo photographer whose work includes the book "Ryokan: The Japanese Inn" and many contributions to leading Japanese magazines. </p><p>Shunichi Kamiya heads the international division of Shufunotomo Co. Ltd., one of Japan's oldest publishers.</p>"A stunning book that takes a look at 28 American homes and gardens that were constructed according to basic principles of traditional Japanese architecture and design...Even a cursory look through this book is bound to leave you buzzing with ideas for building a traditional Japanese dream house, landscaping a garden...or integrating antiques into Western homes or rooms." -- <i>The Daily Yomiuri, Tokyo</i><br><br>A beautiful book...traditional Japanese principles filtered through Western eyes and creativity; old principles which have consequently become successful, modern innovations...For those who are interested in the actual details related to the renovation or construction of their own homes, there is a useful index...listing the names and sources of Japanese goods and design services in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a list of antique shops and markets in Japan." -- <i>Eye-Ai Magazine, Tokyo</i></p><h2>Mist: A Tragicomic Novel</h2><p>A novel that features Augusto Perez, the pampered son of a recently deceased mother; the deceitful, scheming Eugenia, whom Augusto obsessively idealizes; and, Augusto&#39;s dog Orfeo, who gives a funeral oration upon his master&#39;s death.</p><p>A towering figure of political, philosophical, and literary controversy, Miguel de Unamuno was the undisputed intellectual leader of the brilliant Generation of 1898 that ushered in a second golden age of Spanish culture. In the vast and varied body of his work, none conveys his intellectual legacy more effectively than Mist, a monument of the philosophical novel and a masterpiece of modern experimental fiction.<p>Dispensing with the conventions of action, time and place, and analysis of character, Mist proceeds entirely on the strength of dialogue that reveals the struggles of what Unamuno called his "agonists". These include Augusto Perez, the pampered son of a recently deceased mother; the deceitful, scheming Eugenia, whom Augusto obsessively idealizes; and Augusto's dog Orfeo, who gives a funeral oration upon his master's death. Mist even includes a chapter that explains Unamuno's theory of the antinovel.</p><p>Anticipating later writers such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, Unamuno exploited fiction as a vehicle for the exploration of philosophical themes. First published in 1914, Mist exemplified a new kind of novel with which Unamuno aimed to shatter fiction's conventional illusions of reality. This historic reissue includes a foreword by Theodore Ziolkowski.</p>Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936) was one of Spain&#39;s most accomplished authors. His works include The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Peoples, Abel Sanchez, and Love and Pedagogy. Theodore Ziolkowski, a professor of German and comparative literature at Princeton University, is the author of The View from the Tower: Origins of an Antimodernist Image and other books.</p><h2>Afraid</h2><p><b>ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?

You write those chick novels, right?<br><br><b>JA:</b> I write about a female cop who chases serial killers. Some folks think they're pretty scary. Both men and women enjoy the series, but it's a bit harder-edged than the average suspense novel.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> Aren't you the guy that visited 600 bookstores in one summer? Signed thousands of books?<br><br><b>JA:</b> That's me.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> I haven't seen your name on any bestseller lists.<br><br><b>JA:</b> So, how would you describe AFRAID?<br><br><b>Jack:</b> I tried to write a thriller that included every kind of fear possible. Fear of the dark, or being chased, of drowning, of authority, of burning, of losing a loved one, of pain, of disfigurement...and, of course, fear of being horribly murdered.<br><br><b>JA:</b> What's the plot?<br><br><b>Jack:</b> A helicopter crashes near the small town of Safe Haven, Wisconsin. It's so tiny it has a population of 904. But not for long.<br><br><b>JA: </b>So the helicopter lets something loose in town?<br><br><b>Jack:</b> Something horrible. The town can't defend itself either--no police force. Soon it's quarantined, and everyone is fighting for their lives.<br><br><b>JA:</b> I was lucky enough to read an advanced reader copy of AFRAID. It scared the hell out of me.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> Thanks. I'm predicting that at least 25% of people who start the book won't be able to finish it because it's too frightening. It gave me nightmares when I was writing it.<br><br><b>JA:</b> There certainly are some memorable scares.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> I didn't use any chapters in the book. My goal was to go from one high point to another without any breaks. I hope it worked.<br><br><b>JA:</b> It worked for me. You call it "technohorror." What is that?<br><br><b>Jack: </b>The technothriller genre is about fusing modern day science and technology with big thrills. Michael Crichton perfected the form, which has been used to great success by Dan Brown, James Rollins, Steve Berry, and many others. Technohorror views technology in a more sinister way.<br><br><b>JA: </b>Do you think the scenario in AFRAID could happen?<br><br><b>Jack:</b> I wouldn't be surprised if it already has.<br><br><b>JA: </b>You've sort of come out of nowhere. Care to share your writing background?<br><br><b>Jack:</b> It's probably similar to yours. Bitten by the writing bug at a young age, getting a lot of rejections, finally landing a two-book deal with a big publishing house.<br><br><b>JA:</b> I like the Afraid Game on your website.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> Thanks. It's a fun little Flash thing I did. People seem to enjoy it.<br><br><b>JA: </b>So what's next for Jack Kilborn?<br><br><b>Jack:</b> I wrote two other horror novels, TRAPPED and ENDURANCE, which are just as intense as AFRAID. I also wrote the novel DRACULAS with some good friends. It's a balls-to-the-wall zombie book.<br><br><b>JA:</b> Zombies? Aren't draculas vampires?<br><br><b>Jack:</b> Read it and see for yourself.

No offense.<br><b>JA: </b>No offense taken. Maybe you'd like to blurb one of my books, if you have time.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> One of those chick books? Sure. But I can't promise I'll like it.<br><br><b>JA: </b>CHERRY BOMB has a four page sex scene, several torture-murders, and an extended female fist fight.<br><br><b>Jack:</b> I'll give you my address so you can send me a copy.Jack Kilborn is the pseudonym for a bestselling crime fiction writer who lives in a suburb of Chicago. www.jackkilborn.com</p><h2>The Mythic Journey: The Meaning of Myth as a Guide for Life</h2><p>The author of The Mythic Tarot offers readers a colorful, compelling tour of Western mythology, showing how classic stories can help people navigate vital passages in their lives. Original.</p><p>"Myth is the original self-help psychology," according to authors Greene and Sharman-Burke. "For centuries human beings have used myths, fairytales and folklore to explain life's mysteries and make them bearable--from why the seasons change, through complex relationship issues, to the enigma of death." With this lofty purpose in mind, the authors organized this collection of myths according to the stages of human development. For example, part 1 is titled "In the Beginning" and takes us through the early lessons of life--"Parents and Children," "Siblings," and "The Family Inheritance." Follow-up sections include "Becoming an Individual," "Love and Relationships," "Position and Power," and finally "Rites of Passage."<p> The authors offer diverse myths beneath each heading. Within a section on "Leaving Home" we find the myths of Adam and Eve, The Buddha's Departure, and Peredur the Son of Evrawc (a Celtic myth about finding the courage to leave a mother). The research and storytelling are topnotch, but what makes this lavishly illustrated guidebook stand out is the commentary that follows each myth, which explains the advice and guidance within these age-old tales. <i>The Mythic Journey</i> is indeed a self-help book, as readers help themselves to the everlasting lessons these stories offer. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Liz Greene</b> is the author of nineteen books, including the highly successful <i>The Mythic Tarot.</i> Her books have been translated into ten languages, and she gives seminars, workshops, and lectures throughout Europe and the United States. She currently lives in Zurich.</p><h2>Looking East: Western Artists and the Allure of Japan</h2><p>A craze for all things Japanese in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries brought a correspondingly radical shift in Western art, dubbed Japonisme. Leading artists, including Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet, were inspired by Japanese art and culture to create works of singular beauty.

Yet his story of personal struggle, doubt, intense introspection, and inward heroism has never been told fully. As a Jesuit priest, Hopkins?s descent into loneliness and despair and his subsequent recovery are a remarkable and inspiring spiritual journey that will speak to many readers, regardless of their faith or philosophies.<br><br> Paul Mariani, an award-winning poet himself and author of a number of biographies of literary figures, brilliantly integrates Hopkins?s spiritual life and his literary life to create a rich and compelling portrait of a man whose work and life continue to speak to readers a century after his death.</p><p><b>Paul Mariani</b>, an award-winning poet, biographer of William Carlos Williams and Robert Lowell, and critic, holds a Chair in English at Boston College. A former professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, he has lectured widely across the country and lives in Montague, Massachusetts.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda Excepting his juvenilia and various fragments, Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844- 1889) wrote only about 50 poems, most of them "counter, original, spare, strange." As Paul Mariani tells us in his new critical biography, nobody wanted to publish these angst-ridden, prayerful cries from the heart, and so Hopkins was reduced to sharing his work, via letter, with a handful of friends. Even the most sophisticated of these, the future poet laureate Robert Bridges, confessed to finding "The Wreck of the Deutschland" -- Hopkins's first masterpiece -- unsympathetic and incomprehensible. After all, its themes were nothing if not seriously theological: God, Nature, salvation, providence, human despair and spiritual exultation. In themselves such religious subjects, which were to remain central to Hopkins's poetry, would have been attractive to the morally earnest Victorians. But Hopkins eschewed the gentlemanly observance of an Anglican curate. His faith burned hot and strong. As a young Oxford undergraduate, he had converted to Catholicism -- being received into the church by Cardinal Newman himself -- and had then, to his family's shock and sorrow, become a Jesuit. As a result, he wrote less from the heart or mind than from the depths of the soul, either celebrating God and His creation or, later on, addressing his own feelings of loneliness and desolation: "Not, I'll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on thee. . . . O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall/ Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. . . . I am gall, I am heartburn. . . . O thou lord of life, send my roots rain." Like John Donne and T.S. Eliot, both of whom he sometimes resembles, Hopkins pressed hard against what were the boundaries of acceptable poetic convention. Instead of employing nice regular rhymes in iambic pentameter, his poems struggle to contain an ecstatic syntax, the words twisting and contorting and breathlessly straining to articulate some almost inexpressible mystery: "How to k�ep -- is there �ny any, is there none such, nowhere known some, bow or brooch or braid or brace, l�ce, latch or catch or key to keep/ Back beauty, keep it, beauty, beauty, beauty, . . . from vanishing away?" As these opening lines from "The Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo" indicate, Hopkins nearly always ignored the usual tuh-dum, tuh-dum of classic verse for a much looser metric he called "sprung rhythm." This, he wrote, is generated by "scanning by accents or stresses alone, without any account of the number of syllables, so that a foot may be one strong syllable or it may be many light and one strong." Mariani adds that there might be "one, two, three, or even more unstressed syllables between accents. Or none." Sometimes the resulting poems call to mind the iron-hammered alliteration of Old English, made manic with a headlong, rushing breathlessness. They are meant to be recited, not read: Come then, your ways and airs and looks, locks, maiden gear, gallantry and gaiety and grace, Winning ways, airs innocent, maiden manners, sweet looks, loose locks, long locks, lovelocks, gaygear, going gallant, girlgrace -- Resign them, sign them, seal them, send them, motion them with breath, And with sighs soaring, soaring s�ghs, deliver Them; beauty-in-the-ghost, deliver it, early now, long before death Give beauty back, beauty, beauty, beauty, back to God. On the surface, such a swirl of language might resemble logorrhea, yet Hopkins is always striving to be precise, to arrive at what he called the haecceitas, or thisness, the fundamental individuality of an idea or thing. Even now the poetry that resulted seems astonishingly modern. Imagine how rebarbative, how transgressive it must have sounded in the age of Tennyson. There have been several previous biographies of Hopkins, including a fine one by Robert Bernard Martin, an eminent scholar of Victorian poetry. But Mariani's possesses three great strengths: 1) Mariani has lived with Hopkins's poetry his entire life, ever since writing a commentary on the poems as his first book; 2) over the past 40 years, he has produced biographies of American poets who might be loosely viewed as the "sons of Gerard": Hart Crane, William Carlos Williams, John Berryman and Robert Lowell; and 3) Mariani is a believing Catholic, with consequent sympathy and insight into Hopkins's religious convictions and experiences. In several ways, then, this is a spiritual biography, intensely focused on the poet's inner life, coupled with close analyses of his major poems. In general, we think of this great poet as a marginalized figure, both as a Catholic in Anglican England and as an artistic innovator of the most daring sort. (Some scholars have claimed that Hopkins was homosexual as well.) But Mariani reminds us that Hopkins's teachers included the great classicist Benjamin Jowett, that he was a friend of Coleridge's grandson and knew the aesthete Walter Pater, as well as many of the Pre-Raphaelites, that he corresponded with a future poet laureate, and that, late in life, he even visited the studio of an Irish painter, where he met the artist's 21-year-old son, a promising lad named William Butler Yeats. Still, it is true that most of Hopkins's adult life was spent as a Jesuit, studying, preaching, working among the poor of Liverpool, going on retreat, instructing students in ancient languages at University College, Dublin. Even though he passionately loved poetry and music, could draw trees and rocks and flowers with a draftsman's skill and describe them with a naturalist's eye ("What would the world be, once bereft/ Of wet and of wildness?") and enjoyed learning languages (even difficult ones like Welsh), he was, above all, a spiritual being. The world, he once wrote, was "charged with the grandeur of God." Time and again, Father Hopkins would stop writing poetry for a while, having decided that it was "incompatible" with his vocation. While Mariani rightly emphasizes Hopkins's spiritual and artistic life, he also includes the kind of human details that vivify a biography. The poet noted, "Three of my intimate friends at Oxford have . . . drowned themselves, a good many more of my acquaintances and contemporaries have died by their own hands in other ways." Though a Jesuit, Hopkins remained an Englishman and something of a jingoist, telling Bridges that the British defeats early in the Boer War were "an unredeemed disgrace." He complained that Browning's poems give us "pointless photographs of still life" and "minute upholstery descriptions" and elsewhere confessed that "I always knew in my heart Walt Whitman's mind to be more like my own than any other man's living. As he is a very great scoundrel this is not a pleasant confession." Being familiar from the confession box with humankind at its most sinful and base, Father Hopkins deeply admired Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, adding that his own Hyde was even "worse." Once, according to a student, he looked up from a lecture on Homer's Helen to say, "You know, I never saw a naked woman," adding after a moment, "I wish I had." Like many modern readers, he even regarded "The Windhover" as "the best poem I ever wrote": "I caught this morning morning's minion, kingdom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding/ Of the rolling level underneath him steady air." Hopkins seems to have been quite worn out when he died at age 44, though he may have suffered from undiagnosed Crohn's disease or been the victim of typhoid (rats had been seen in the college drains and kitchen). While Bridges promised Hopkins's mother that he would collect his friend's poems and publish them, he waited until 1918 before bringing out The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins. It took 12 years to exhaust the edition of 750 copies. But by then its author had been discovered and acclaimed not only a great poet but also a de facto modernist. Recently, one of those copies of that first edition of the poems sold for more than $7,000. Hopkins once wrote, "I am soft sift/ In an hourglass -- at the wall/ Fast, but mined with a motion, a drift,/ And it crowds and it combs to the fall." This is, of course, the human condition, prey to the tyranny of time. But Hopkins also knew that he had been saved from oblivion or worse by God's gift of His only begotten son. While one may or may not believe this, there can be no doubt that Hopkins himself will be read and loved as long as poetry matters.

They were soul mates, but in 2001, Ed (at the vital age of 53) began to show signs of Alzheimer's disease.

A frequent speaker and facilitator at conferences and a teacher of mindfulness, she lives in central Vermont.1<br><br>Ed Epstein was my third husband. This fact might make you think I took marriage lightly, but just the opposite was true. I got married too quickly because I wanted to do the right thing. And, maybe more important, I didn't know how to evaluate the men who stepped forward and wanted to marry me. Marriage #1 and Marriage #2 were to men who were much older than me: They idealized me and needed me and I thought that meant they loved me. I am sympathetic to my younger self, as I have come to understand her, but she was clueless about choosing a partner and often confused about what she was looking for. As I look back now, I don't regret my "starter marriages." My growing up being what it was, I congratulate myself on doing as well as I did. It was hard to find a partner when I didn't know how to look for one, perhaps even harder because I confused being loved with being needed. I always felt my mother "loved" me when she mostly needed me for emotional comfort and sharing.<br><br>My first marriage took place in my senior year of college. I married a philosophy professor, 15 years older than me, who pursued me for a year with the conviction that he and I were meant for each other. I was Richard's third wife and became the mother of his second and third children as well as the stepmother for his first son. If I had had my eyes open, I might have wondered about these facts, but they seemed irrelevant at the time. We divorced when I was 27 years old and I moved away (with our two young children) to a distant city and began my graduate studies. Richard and I have remained friends over the years. I am also a friend of his second wife (the one before me) who is the mother of my stepson, my children's half brother. For most of my children's growing up, they had plenty of contact with their father. Grown up now, my children recognize how ill matched their parents are.<br><br>My second marriage, when I was 28, was to one of my graduate school professors, 11 years older than me, who pursued me for a year with the conviction that I was meant for him. Both of my first husbands were intelligent, articulate, and well educated. They had generous spirits and they wanted and needed me, but they were not interested in really getting to know me on a first-person basis. I filled up a place in them that had been empty and that was that. In the first 12 years of my adult life, in which I was mostly married (as a friend once said of me, I was "single for about 10 minutes"), I can now say I was unsure if the person I was sleeping next to in bed could even be called my "friend." My marriages, like most marriages back then, were not reciprocal or mutual. My husbands and I were not equals. As Jane Fonda has aptly put it, they wanted me to be in their stories, but they didn't want to be in mine.<br><br>I did not try to change them or rebel against them. As I had with my mother, I tried to adapt to the ways they needed me until I could no longer do so without losing my life force. With Ed Epstein, by contrast, my life force was enhanced and my being was increased. One of the extraordinary things about my relationship with Ed was that I met him before I had married either of these other men. On January 2, 1969, I took a plane from Cleveland, Ohio, to New York City where I was to rendezvous with Richard. He wanted to marry me, but I was unsure about my love for him. When I boarded the plane, I immediately spied in the row behind me what seemed to be an interracial gay couple: two men seated side by side with the black man's hand cozily placed on the white man's thigh. "That's interesting," I thought to myself, having never before seen such a couple. Turning around, I slyly stared through the space between the seats. Then the white guy suddenly popped up and sat down next to me. "Hi," he said. "My name is Eddie Epstein and I noticed you looking at me." Ed was tall, slender, and, it seemed to me, impossibly handsome. He looked directly at me with large liquid deep-brown eyes through long lashes that curled up. His manner was earnest and anxious and his thick black hair rippled down to his shoulders. He told me he was a theater student at New York University and was lonely and confused. He said that he wasn't gay but had brought home a gay friend from his program because he liked the guy and he wanted to shock his parents. He told me about his life and his difficulties in finding a relationship with a woman (something about there being so many gay men in the theater program and so few women?). Nothing like this had ever before happened to me! Ed was well-spoken, vulnerable, and seemingly open and honest. I still recall what it felt like to be looking straight into his face: It felt like we had known each other forever. The whole thing was exhilarating and frightening and confusing.<br><br>When he asked about me, I told him about Richard waiting for me at the Integral Yoga Society in uptown Manhattan. I told Ed that Richard had been pursuing me, wanting to marry me, but I was ambivalent. I also told Ed about the year I had just spent abroad in Europe and how it had changed my perspective on myself and my life.<br><br>When our plane landed, Ed asked me to have dinner with him. "Don't marry that man. He's too old for you." I had never before gone off with a stranger--and certainly not with someone who had a male companion--but there was something about Ed that seemed totally familiar and immediately trustworthy. His openness felt just like mine. I was 21 years old and a senior at Ohio University; Ed was 20 years old and a junior at New York University. I got into the taxi with him and his obviously angry friend (who jumped out during a red traffic-light stop in Manhattan) and we continued talking. After dinner we talked all night, and then, the next day, I called Richard to meet us for dinner in the Village. The three of us had an awkward, but friendly, dinner at a Chinese restaurant where Ed and Richard got exactly the same message in their fortune cookie--"You have a mutual friend." They had a laugh over that.<br><br>Although Ed had made a huge impact, and he wanted a long-distance relationship with me, I reluctantly said goodbye to him and chose to be with Richard. I felt Ed was too young and confused to provide the "stability" my life seemed to call out for (in fact, I was too young and confused). Later in 1969, I married Richard, who convinced me he would "provide security." In the interim between meeting Ed and marrying Richard, Ed and I talked many times by telephone and became friends. I invited Ed to my wedding. He made the long trek on a Greyhound bus from New York City to Athens, Ohio. He showed up after the wedding but was in time for the party. Ed seemed excited to see me, and he brought me the Judy Collins album that included the song "Pretty Polly." Even on the evening of my marriage to Richard, I had the strong feeling that Ed and I belonged together. When Richard and I divorced in 1974, I tried to find Ed. I called all the phone numbers I had for him, but none of them worked. In 1975, I got married again.<br><br>Then Ed stepped back into my world without my knowing it. He was a graduate student in a seminar I was teaching in the fall of 1981 at Bryn Mawr College where I was on the faculty of the Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research. Ed enrolled in it as a part of his masters degree in clinical social work. It was a clinical seminar on counseling skills, and Ed and I sat across the table from each other for 90 minutes twice a week in class and sometimes we ran into each other outside of class, too. For 6 months, we did not recognize each other because repression was at work. Repression is an unconscious barrier against recognizing something you already know--something that would make you terribly anxious if you recognized it. Ed was now a balding middle-aged man with a beard, no longer slim. When we spoke to each other outside class, we often felt nervous (as we discovered later when we talked about it). Once he slipped on the ice in the parking lot and fell down hard on his side. I felt a shock run through me when I touched his arm to help him up. Although our appearances had changed a lot (not only was Ed different, I no longer had a hippie-style), repression played a bigger part in hiding our actual identities--who we were to each other.<br><br>On the morning of March 2, 1982, a dream got past my repression: In the dream, I am in bed with Ed as he was when I met him in 1969. I am startled to recognize that he is Eddie Epstein because I know I have an Ed Epstein in my class. I wake up and say to myself, "Could that be the student in my class?" Soothing myself--"I never forget a face; that couldn't be the same guy"--I go back to sleep. Once again, I have the same dream, but the man in bed with me is older. Again, I wake with anxiety and go back to sleep. The second time I go back to sleep, I dream of being in bed with my student!<br><br>Ed was scheduled to do a clinical presentation in my seminar--about an African-American family he was seeing, under supervision, in therapy about their son who was gay. Of course, reading his case report contributed to lifting my repression. When Ed came by my office to pick up the video equipment, I asked him to step inside. "Last night I had a dream about a man I knew maybe 15 years ago. He was from New York City and his name was Eddie Epstein," I say hesitantly. Ed looks nervous. "I was a student in New York City around that time, but I don't remember you. There are a lot of people with the Epstein name." "I met this guy on an airplane flying from Cleveland, Ohio, to New York City in 1969." Ed looks more nervous. "Geez, that's odd, because I grew up in Cleveland, but I really don't remember you." "This Eddie Epstein was studying acting in New York," I say, narrowing my gaze to his eyes. "Man, I studied acting in New York City, but I really don't remember you!" "This Ed Epstein came to my wedding in Athens, Ohio, where I married Richard," I say with a dry mouth, feeling faint. "Oh my God! Polly, that was me!" We stare at each other. Lenses are shifting like tectonic plates inside me, bringing a new life into focus. "Oh, no!" I say silently to myself, "I will NOT tear my life apart again! I will not disrupt my children. NO. I don't care about love. NO!" Ed suggests we meet up later in the day to talk about what "has happened in our lives since 1969." Then we step right into the seminar where he stumbles awkwardly through his presentation.<br><br>My second marriage has already reached a point of conflict and disruption: I do not confide in my husband about any of my feelings or inner life. I often keep him at arm's length. I seek counsel from my friends, but I don't count my husband as a friend. We had married in St. Louis in 1975, and we were trying to build a family with our four young children in tow: ages 2, 3, 4, and 5 at the time of our union. His children stayed with us during the summers and other times when they could be away from their school in Washington, DC. My second husband offered Richard, my first husband, a job at the college where we worked, so Richard moved into a small house across the street from our modest two-story bungalow in a suburb of St. Louis. My children often ran through the neighborhood shouting "Daddy!" to different guys.<br><br>I entered serious long-term psychotherapy (eventually it became analysis) right around this time. I had had some psychotherapy during my first marriage also, but now I was beginning to see more clearly the nature of my unconscious dynamics. I try to speak haltingly to my husband about my insights, but they make no sense to him. I can tell that his initial idealization of me is turning into resentment. Our relationship begins to feel like a repeat of what happened between my mother and me.<br><br>I become a doctoral student in psychology at Washington University. When I graduate in 1980, I am offered a tenure-track teaching position at Bryn Mawr College, just outside Philadelphia. At the same time, my husband applies for a job in Chicago and we consider having a commuter marriage. We are not spending much time together as a couple, outside the time we spend as a whole family with the children, and we disagree about many things, especially spiritual and emotional issues. I am truly uncomfortable in my skin when we try to be intimate. All the same, we want to make our marriage work. Ultimately, he moves with me, and my children, and takes an administrative post working for the state of Pennsylvania. After arriving at Bryn Mawr College where we live in a house on campus, hardly a day passes that I am not nervous and unhappy. Settling into a whole new routine and taking on a new academic position while mothering young children means I am very stressed. My relationship with my husband is no comfort. Our disputes are serious, threatening, and disruptive. I continue in therapy by telephone and for a while he tries to find a therapist, but he does not find a good match.</p><h2>Stacey&#39;s Mistake (Baby-sitters Club)</h2><p>Stacey invites her Baby-sitters Club friends down for a weekend in New York City, but the big city creates big problems for the girls</p><p></p><h2>How to Feed Your Cheeky Monkey</h2><p>Discover the big moments and daily routines of every toddler&#39;s life with lovable animal characters and a playful rhyming text.

Her first How to Live on Almost Nothing and Have Plenty and her fourth The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Preserving Food at Home are considered classics and receive the highest ratings in their category. Though these books were originally written in 1979 and 1982,they could have been written yesterday. In 1979 the economy tanked, jobs were scarce, the cost of food, gas and medical care was skyrocketing and banks were not lending. Many people lost their homes. Five years before this, she and her husband Ray lost their oldest son to kidney disease and three of their remaining children had various illnesses that had used everything Ray could earn, even though he worked two to three jobs at a time while Janet cared for those who were sick. They had reached the point were they had to make some changes in their lifestyle and become food self-sufficient in order to be able to pay off these debts. With the help of their daughters Mary and Kim and their son David, they became so successful that an editor from a major New York publisher asked Janet to write a book about their experiences. Janet and Ray had spent time on farms in their childhood, but neither had the experience needed to get into major food production and small animal husbandry. When she states that she learned to milk a cow with the cow in one hand and the how-to book in the other, Janet wasn&#39;t joking. By taking their time, reading everything they could on the subjects they were interested in and working hard, they succeeded. Writing this book to make things easier for others was a joy for her. Readers can choose to do just one or two of the projects, or do it all. Going slow is the secret. Janet&#39;s books are written in easy to understand style. Fan&#39;s writing to her describe it as just like sitting down at the kitchen table and having a talk with a friend. Her methods are simple and inexpensive. Both books were instant successes. The new printing of How To Live On Almost Nothing and Have Plenty is available on Amazon and the Beginner&#39;s Guide to Preserving Food at Home is available at all books stores (they will order it if it is not in stock) and on Amazon. In 1996 Janet and Ray moved to Florica for enjoy a more relaxed lifestyle. She continues to grwo vegetables and herbs in large containers and cans and freezes a variety of fruits,vegetables and preserves.</p><h2>Alabaster&#39;s Song: Christmas through the Eyes of an Angel</h2><p>Lying in bed, trying to fall asleep on Christmas Eve, a young boy spends his time asking questions of the angel that adorns the top of the Christmas tree, but Alabaster the angel does not answer him, until he asks &#34;What was it like to see Bethlehem?&#34;</p><p><p>More than 120 million readers have found inspiration and encouragement in the writings of Max Lucado.

I slid the pen inside my worn leather journal and tossed it on my cot. As I stood, the shooting pain in my back reminded me I was not sleeping at the Hilton. &nbsp;</p><p>The stark cold walls, the constant clamor of cursing and flushing toilets wasn't at all how I pictured my life. It was a stagnant existence, every day like the one before and the one after. As unjust as I know that to be, nothing I could do will change my situation or my reputation. The latter, as crazy as it seemed, still mattered most to me even after seventeen years. I would prefer not to be remembered as the monster the local newspapers dubbed me, and especially not as a baby killer.</p><p>&#x201c;Hurry up,&#x201d; a new officer growled through the narrow horizontal opening in the door. &#x201c;Give me both your hands.&#x201d; His tone startled me, and I bit the inside corner of my lip, a nervous habit I&#x2019;d tried and failed to break. This time I tasted blood.</p><p>I handled officer changes better than some on the row. Jada, I suspected, was right now sitting with her hands clasped around her legs, rocking back and forth like someone residing on a psych ward. She once told me when she was little she never knew who her &#x201c;daddy&#x201d; would be when she woke up in the morning. I pictured a four-year-old Jada peering around the corner in footsie pajamas, surveying the situation &#x2014;praying whoever she might see at the breakfast table would be kind to her. A sanguine version in my mind, but Jada still panics, even more than the rest of us, when an untried voice gives her orders.</p><p>I placed my left arm through the slit and elevated my right shoulder a bit to get my other arm to cooperate. My limbs had gotten stiff and slow, and sitting in a cell all day didn&#x2019;t help. The officer pulled my wrists together, snapping the cuffs tighter than necessary before he pushed my arms back through the hole and unlocked the cell door. &#x201c;Your attorney is waiting on you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;I avoided eye contact with him as he escorted me, kept my eyes on the floor counting the grey concrete slabs to keep calm. My count was interrupted when Roni started screaming.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep it down,&#x201d; the officer snapped, &#x201c;or you won&#x2019;t get a shower this week either.&#x201d; I knew by the sharpness in his voice that he meant what he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ok, Cowboy,&#x201d; Roni shouted back. &#x201c;Ok.&#x201d;</p><p>Cowboy spelled backwards is YOBWOC, and it stood for Young Obnoxious Bastards We Often Con, (one of the many useless things I&#x2019;ve learned in prison). I don&#x2019;t include myself in the &#x201c;we&#x201d; part of that acronym&#x2014;I just do my best to get along&#x2014;but Roni does. She&#x2019;s the one in here I&#x2019;ve tried to connect to the most, the one I&#x2019;ve tried to help. Maybe it&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s young enough to be my daughter, but for her own sometimes inexplicable reasons, Roni chooses to make trouble whenever she has a chance, or whenever she has no chance at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Only four of the seven cells in this wing of the prison were occupied on Death Row, but only outsiders called it that. Those who resided here called it Hotel Hell. On the inside, hope was something no one seemed to believe in except for me.</p><p>Mainly, I just missed the ordinary. The uncomplicated, taken-for-granted things like the sound of my husband&#x2019;s house keys rattling the front door at exactly two minutes before six o&#x2019;clock, or the buzzer on the duct-taped dryer door signaling a load of warm towels was ready to be folded; the gritty feel of the hot driveway on my bare feet as I walked to the mail box to raise the rusted red flag, or sitting in my cold minivan making sure the windows defrosted before driving my daughter to school. Or burying my face in the space between William&#x2019;s chest and his rolled chin just to smell his sweet baby-powdered scent after he had a bath.&nbsp;</p><p>The officer squeezed my upper arm as he guided me through the vacant day room and buzzed us through one door and then another before we entered one of the attorney-client holding rooms. &#x201c;Room&#x201d; was a generous term, but at least it was bigger than my cell and offered some contact, meaning my attorney could shake my handcuffed hands if he so desired or slide a paper across the chipped Formica table without hitting glass.</p><p>Ben Taylor stood when I entered. He&#x2019;d represented me for the past five years and had become one of the few non-institutionalized faces I saw. His face today didn&#x2019;t look that good.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello Grace, please take a seat.&#x201d; I sat down with my feet and hands still cuffed.</p><p>&#x201c;Ben, how are you?&#x201d; I was delaying, wanting to hear anything other than the news I feared he was about to give me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; His slight southern accent made whatever awful words he was about to tell me sound more tolerable. Most of the guard and many of the inmates here had come from all over. Ben&#x2019;s soft tone reminded me of home.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you found her?&#x201d; I asked, hoping he would give me something to cling to.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Grace. My office still has not been able to get in touch with her.&#x201d;</p><p>After all these years, I still woke in the morning with a sweat-soaked shirt stuck to my skin, dreaming about my daughter sitting alone at her dad&#x2019;s funeral. Abandoned. I knew I couldn&#x2019;t make my daughter forgive me, believe me, or even come to see me, but I wouldn&#x2019;t stop hoping. I&#x2019;d stopped calling many years ago, figuring the refusal of collect calls meant the expense was too much for her to handle. Eleven years, five months, and twenty-seven days separated me from the last time I&#x2019;d heard her voice&#x2014;the last time I&#x2019;d heard anyone call me Mom. A word I&#x2019;d never longed to hear until I did.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not why I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I am afraid we didn&#x2019;t get the news we had hoped for. The court refused to hear the latest appeal.&#x201d;</p><p>I dropped my head and tried not to make my attorney, my only believer, feel any worse than I knew he already did. Whatever hope I&#x2019;d carried into the room had fled by the time I looked up.</p><p>My lawyer rubbed his forehead. &#x201c;Grace, the judge has set your execution date.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>SOPHIE</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophie knew she&#x2019;d made mistakes. The kind of mistakes an &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x201d; wouldn&#x2019;t erase and a &#x201c;please understand&#x201d; wouldn&#x2019;t go far to repair. Not after all this time. The car in her driveway, her oversized lake house, and her bulging bank account made her life look perfect on the surface. By anyone else&#x2019;s standards, she should be fulfilled, ecstatic, but...Maybe it was because she was turning thirty this year, but her heart seemed to be catching up with her deception and she hated that feeling.</p><p>She sat where she did every morning after Thomas left for work&#x2014;with her coffee on the veranda off the master bedroom overlooking the lake. This spot helped quiet her mind and energize her for the day ahead. At least it usually did. But this October morning felt different somehow.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She set her mug down and snuggled as deep as she could into her chenille bathrobe. The sharp chill in the air caused her hands to shiver and she looked down at them, wishing she still had the red snowflake mittens she&#x2019;d worn as a little girl. Holes on both of them, right at the tops of her palms under the first two fingers, from hours of raking leaves in her backyard, just so she could jump in and bury herself in the pile, counting the seconds until her dad would find her. <i>Sophie, Sophie, come out wherever you are. </i>After many minutes of pretending he had no idea where she was, her dad would fall into the pile on top of her. She felt like she&#x2019;d never stop giggling. &#x201c;You got me good this time, pumpkin,&#x201d; he would say to her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sophie tried to recall the last time she&#x2019;d actually done something like that just for the fun of it, or experienced some overpowering emotion other than the flat line she had grown accustomed to. She did feel happy when she laid her head on her husband Thomas and watched his chest rise up and down as he slept, or when she put together puzzles with children at the hospital, but those feelings were short-lived.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head, scolding herself for the psychoanalysis, and decided to push whatever these strange emotions were back to the unexamined place she kept in a carefully tucked away corner of her mind. She controlled her life now. No one could take that from her, not anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts were interrupted by her vibrating phone. Seven new emails, two new texts, and one missed call. <i>Guess my walk down memory lane affected my hearing.</i> One text from Thomas, one from Mindy, and a call from a number she did not recognize.</p><p>She was typing a reply to Thomas when Mindy&#x2019;s text vibrated again.&nbsp; <i>Not coming today, talk to you later, will still help with fundraiser. </i></p><p>She checked the clock on her phone. The time for figuring out her tangled lack of emotions had expired. She needed to get going.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ###</p><p>Sophie hated Thursdays. Ever since they&#x2019;d bought a house in West Lake several years ago, Thomas had insisted it would be good for her to get to know some of the other women in the neighborhood. Sophie resisted at first&#x2014;faking end of the week migraines and even an ankle sprain&#x2014;until Thomas noticed a pattern and forced the issue. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve&nbsp; got to get out of this house and make some friends.&#x201d;</p><p>After a few months, she finally gave in and started attending the monthly meetings the women called &#x201c;the book club.&#x201d; Sophie secretly called the women &#x201c;the synthetics.&#x201d; A room full of designer-dressed plastic ladies sitting around drinking margaritas while discussing the latest scandals lurking within their gated community. The books they were supposed to be reading never came up.</p><p>Sophie didn&#x2019;t exclude herself from that less-than-complimentary stereotype. On more than one occasion she&#x2019;d presented herself to be something she was not. It wasn&#x2019;t that the ladies hadn&#x2019;t been nice to Sophie since she and Thomas moved into the neighborhood. Most had been welcoming, since the first day actually, when a few of them brought a large welcome basket of wine and cheese and left it by the front door. It had a note attached: <i>Sorry we missed you! Dinner at the Parkers&#x2019; Friday night?</i></p><p>Before that first dinner at the Parker&#x2019;s, she&#x2019;d changed outfits three times, ran to the bathroom to throw-up twice, all before finally settling on a tweed blazer and dark blue jeans.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mindy Parker (who happened to work at the same hospital as Thomas) had put Sophie at ease right away, and she and Sophie had developed somewhat of a friendship since that night. Maybe it was the way her house looked. Clean, but not perfect; functional, but not organized. Chocolate cookie crumbs and milk drops lingered on the kitchen counter and shouted Mindy was not trying to impress anyone. Sophie envied that attitude. Mindy always let her two-year-old twin girls say hello and goodnight to everyone before excusing herself to tuck them into bed.</p><p>Mindy&#x2019;s friend Eva, however, wasn&#x2019;t as genuine. Sophie could picture her as an 8th grader, pointing and whispering at an unfortunate misfit, unlucky enough to have inherited an older exiled siblings hand-me-downs. Sophie could feel Eva&#x2019;s eyes scanning her fashion selection whenever she walked into a room, and she always seemed a little too interested when Thomas told a story. Sophie wasn&#x2019;t normally the jealous type, but something about Eva&#x2019;s smile when she looked at him made her more than a little uncomfortable.</p><p>While Thomas socialized with all of the husbands they had met in the neighborhood on occasion to play tennis or a round of golf, Mindy was the only relationship Sophie had cared to foster outside of the book club and other cursory social events. Even that friendship had gotten only so deep. The less people knew about her the better.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ###</p><p>All the usual &#x201c;book club&#x201d; cars were present and accounted for when Sophie pulled her Land Rover behind Eva&#x2019;s brand-new red BMW. She could see Eva and three other women (all of whose names escaped Sophie) walking in, chatting with fast and flippy hand movements, and whispering about something Sophie wasn&#x2019;t quite sure she wanted to hear. Since no one ever seemed interested in discussing their assigned book, Sophie had turned the monthly meetings into planning events for her latest endeavor&#x2014;a fund she had created for indigent children at St. John&#x2019;s Hospital.</p><p>To raise money, she was planning a Secret Chef fundraiser that she described as: <i>A soon-to-be annual wine and food tasting event that will boast the most culinary delectable dishes ever served in the south. The Chefs and their restaurants will &#x201c;surprise&#x201d; the highest bidders with sensational award packages sure to satisfy even the pickiest palates</i>&#x2014;or something along those lines. Sophie fine-tuned her pitch as she grabbed her laptop out of the back of her SUV.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear about Stephen?&#x201d; Eva said before she had a chance to set her bag down or take off her jacket. Sophie, not sure if Eva meant to include her, didn&#x2019;t immediately respond.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Did you hear me? Did you hear what&#x2019;s going on with Stephen?&#x201d;</p><p>Sophie didn&#x2019;t want to appear out of the loop or give Eva the satisfaction of knowing about whatever was happening first quickly replied, &#x201c;Yes, heard about it last night. Thomas told me. I can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d; A calculated response, since she had no idea what was going on with Stephen. But one thing she knew for sure&#x2013;&#x2013;Eva loved to be the first to give details.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, for those of you who <i>don&#x2019;t</i> know...&#x201d; Eva launched into the gossip without taking a breath. &#x201c;Stephen moved out. Mindy is devastated, they just put in a pool and all. One bejeweled hand flipped her shiny hair over her shoulder. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t totally blame him. Have you seen Mindy lately? Not exactly keeping herself up. Never met an ice-cream cone she didn&#x2019;t like.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nbs...</p></p><h2>Conan: The People of the Black Circle</h2><p>Book Club Edition, 1977, The Authorized Edition, a like-new appearing, unread, unworn, unopened, unmarked hardcover, with an almost like-new dust jacket except for slight rubbing at the top spine end and very slight rubbing at the outer corners, from Berkley/Putnam.

These extraordinary creatures stole scene after scene from human actors, and this book shows how he developed them.When writing his autobiography, An Animated Life, Ray Harryhausen and Tony Dalton realized that they were working with a collection of art too extensive to share in one book. As a result, this companion volume lets readers explore the hoard of artwork that Harryhausen has preserved in his London home.Reproduced to the highest standards, this artwork includes preliminary sketches, elaborate drawings of key scenes, and storyboards, all produced as he prepared to undertake the laborious task of animating each creature. Also shown here are the tiny, elaborately artic</p><p>RAY HARRYHAUSEN, universally revered as the grandmaster of special effects in the pre-computer age, was born in Los Angeles but now lives in London. <b><br></b><br>TONY DALTON has worked as a film publicist and historian and now runs his own archive research company. Together, they have also written Ray&#x2019;s autobiography, <i>An Animated Life </i>and <i>A Century of Stop-Motion Animation</i>.Fantasy-film geeks revere Harryhausen's technically dazzling, meticulously crafted movies employing the painstaking technique of stop-motion animation. This coffee-table volume showcases the material Harryhausen discovered in his archives while researching <i>Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life</i> (2004). Harryhausen stresses that this book isn't as much about animation as about the previsualization that precedes making the models that will be filmed; accordingly, it focuses on sketches, key drawings, storyboards, and preliminary clay models rather than film stills. Thematic chapters cover Harryhausen's early work, including his stint with animation legend Willis O'Brien on the <i>King Kong</i> quasi sequel, <i>Mighty Joe Young</i>; dinosaur movies, such as <i>One Million Years B.C.</i>; sci-fi flicks such as the 1953 <i>War of the Worlds</i>; and the series of films portraying the adventures of Sinbad of, more or less, the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. Like O'Brien before him, Harryhausen hugely influenced younger filmmakers. In the introduction, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> director Peter Jackson says he grew up wanting to become Harryhausen's apprentice and notes that the animator's films "have lost none of their ability to provoke wonder." <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He seems to have been known by different names in many parts of India, appearing and disappearing through the years. His western devotees of recent years knew him as &#39;Neem Karoli Baba,&#39; but mostly as &#39;Maharajii&#39;--a nickname so commonplace in India that one can often hear a tea vendor addressed thus. Just as he said, he was &#39;Nobody.&#39; He gave no discourses; the briefest, simplest stories were his teachings. Usually he sat or lay on a wooden bench wrapped in a plaid blanket while a few devotees sat around him. Visitors came and went; they were given food, a few words, a nod, a slap on the head or back, and they were sent away. There was gossip and laughter for he loved to joke. Orders for running the ashram were given, usually in a piercing yell across the compound. Sometimes he sat in silence, absorbed in another world to which we could not follow, but bliss and peace poured down on us. Who he was was no more than the experience of him, the nectar of his presence, the totality of his absence--enveloping us now like his plaid blanket. --Anjani In 1967 I met Neem Karoli Baba, a meeting which changed the course of my life. In the depth of his compassion, wisdom, humor, power and love I found human possibility never before imagined...an extraordinary integration of spirit and form. I was with him only briefly for he left his body in 1973, still he entered my heart as living truth, and his presence continues to enrich and guide my life.</p><p></p><h2>Confessions (Nelson&#39;s Royal Classics)</h2><p><p>The premier line of Classic literature from the greatest Christian authors.

Yet, writes John Keegan in this slender but thorough portrait, Winston Churchill was unquestionably the right man for the time.<p> Few biographers are better equipped than Keegan, the eminent military historian, to write of Churchill as a wartime leader. Indeed, Keegan suggests, Churchill was never more at ease than when confronting some fierce enemy, whether across the English Channel or a range of Afghan hills; it was from the saddle that he developed his "vision of how an enlightened empire might transform the future of mankind." The rise of other, less enlightened empires helped put an end to his own, but Churchill steadfastly insisted on a strong role for Great Britain in the postwar world--in which he succeeded, even if voters turned him out of office almost as soon as the war ended.</p><p> Keegan's respectful portrait assesses Churchill's many accomplishments (and a few noteworthy failures) as he sought, in Churchill's ringing words, to "resist oppression, to protect the weak, to vindicate the profound but unwritten Law of Nations." Admirers of Churchill and students of his time will find much of value in these pages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>John Keegan is one of the most distinguished contemporary military historians and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

Now in paperback!</p><p>Mary Pope Osborne is the author of the best-selling series The Magic Tree House. She has also written many acclaimed retellings of myths and folktales and works of historical fiction.For graduates of D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths, these installments of the Tales from the Odyssey series deftly distill episodes from Homer's epic. Osborne (the Magic Tree House series) opens the first volume as Odysseus receives King Agamemnon's orders to join the fight against Troy, and bring home the Greek queen, Helen, kidnapped by a Trojan prince. In succinct chapters, the author then traces the labyrinthine journey of Odysseus and his men as they attempt to sail home to Ithaca. She touches on their encounters with the island of the lotus-eaters, Polyphemus the Cyclops and Aeolus, god of the winds. The second book brings the hero and his band to the island of the cannibal giants who devour a number of Odysseus's men, the palace of Circe the enchantress, who transforms some of the Greeks into swine, and the Land of the Dead, where Odysseus encounters his mother's ghost. Plot takes precedence over character development, but the hero's bravery and fidelity come through in his actions. In brief chapters and concise sentences, Osborne pares down each of these adventures into easily absorbed, swiftly paced episodes that will keep readers anxiously anticipating book three, Mermaids and Monsters, scheduled for spring 2003. Each volume includes a glossary of gods and goddesses and a pronunciation guide to the characters' names, which also help recommend this series as a tidy introduction to Homer and to Greek mythology.

Fighting itself can be a source of great, perhaps even the greatest, joy; out of this joy and fascination an entire culture has grown&#x2013;from the war paint of tribal warriors to today&#x2019;s &#x201c;tiger suits,&#x201d; from Julius Caesar&#x2019;s red cloak to Douglas McArthur&#x2019;s pipe, from the decorative shields of ancient Greece to today&#x2019;s nose art, and from the invention of chess around 600 A.D. to the most modern combat simulators. The culture of war has its own traditions, laws and customs, rituals, ceremonies, music, art, literature, and monuments since the beginning of civilization.<br><br>Throughout the ages, the culture of war has usually been highly esteemed. Not so in today&#x2019;s advanced countries, which tend either to mock it (&#x201c;military intelligence is to intelligence what military music is to music&#x201d;) or to denounce it as &#x201c;militaristic.&#x201d; This provocative book, the first of its kind, sets out to show how wrongheaded, and even dangerous, such attitudes are. The Culture of War argues that men and women, contrary to the hopes of some, are just as fascinated by war today as they have been in the past. A military that <br>has lost touch with the culture of war is doomed not merely to defeat but to disintegration.<br><br>Innovative, authoritative, and riveting, this is a major work by one of the world&#x2019;s greatest and most insightful military historians.</p><p>Martin van Creveld, professor of history at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, is one of the best-known experts on military history and strategy. He has written eighteen books, which have been translated into fourteen languages; most notable among them are The Changing Face of War: Lessons of Combat, from Marne to Iraq; Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton; Command in War; and The Transformation of War. Professor van Creveld has consulted to the defense departments of numerous governments, including that of the United States. He was the second civilian expert ever to be invited to address the Israeli General Staff, and has lectured or taught at practically every institute of strategic military study. Van Creveld has appeared on CNN, BBC, and other international networks and has been featured in many magazines and newspapers, including Newsweek and the International Herald Tribune.Advance praise for The Culture of War<br><br>&#x201c;This splendid volume affirms what we already know: Martin van Creveld is the most creative, most insightful, and most important military historian writing in English today.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Andrew J. Bacevich, author of<i> </i>The New American Militarism: How Americans Are Seduced by War <br><br>&#x201c;For more than thirty years Martin van Creveld has been one of the world&#x2019;s foremost military thinkers. In<i> </i>The Culture of War, van Creveld once more shows an exceptional mastery of his subject as he explores a vital but rarely acknowledged aspect of war, its deep-rooted culture.

But in her 63rd bestselling novel, Danielle Steel proves that when two hopelessly mismatched people share a love for art, a passion for each other, and a city like Paris, nothing is truly impossible...or is it?<br> <br> Everything Sasha does is within the boundaries of tradition. Liam is sockless in December. Sasha is widowed, a woman who knows she was lucky enough to be married to the most wonderful man in the world and thankful for every moment they had. Liam is half in and half out of a marriage that only a &#x201c;wacky&#x201d; artist could manage, and that his own impossibly impulsive behavior has helped tear apart. But while Sasha has been methodically building her father&#x2019;s Parisian art gallery into an intercontinental success story, Liam has been growing into one of the most original and striking young painters of his time. So while the two are utterly unalike&#x2013;and a nine-year age difference stares them squarely in the face&#x2013;the miracle of art brings them crashing together. Now the question is, can Sasha guard her reputation while juggling a secret, somewhat scandalous relationship? And how can Liam, who lives for the moment, put up with a woman who insists on having things her own way, in her own style, and at her own time?<br> <br> For Sasha, it&#x2019;s a matter of keeping Liam hidden from her grown children and well-heeled clientele as she commutes between New York and Paris and two thriving galleries. For Liam, it&#x2019;s about creating chaos out of order, bringing out the wild streak that Sasha barely knows she has, of choosing pizza over foie gras, and making love when others are busy making money. That is, until a family tragedy suddenly alters Liam&#x2019;s life&#x2013;and forces a choice and a sacrifice that neither one of them could have expected. But from the snow falling on the Tuileries to the joy of eating ice cream by candlelight, the artist and the art dealer have tasted perfection. And giving up now might just be the most impossible thing of all.<br> <br> With unerring insight into the hearts of men and women&#x2013; and into the soul of the artist &#x2013;Danielle Steel takes us into a world of glamour and genius, priceless art and dazzling creativity. From the luxurious galleries of Europe to the endless beaches of the Hamptons, <b>ImPossible </b>weaves an extraordinary tale of love and compromise, of taking chances and counting blessings. With brilliant color and breathtaking emotion, Danielle Steel has written her most compelling novel to date.</p><p>Danielle Steel has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 560 million copies of her novels sold. Her many international bestsellers include <b>Sisters</b>, <b>H.R.H.</b>, <b>Coming Out</b>, <b>The House</b>, <b>Toxic Bachelors</b>, <b>Miracle</b>, and other highly acclaimed novels. She is also the author of <b>His Bright Light</b>, the story of her son Nick Traina&#x2019;s life and death.<i>Chapter One<br> </i><br> <br> <i>The Suvery Gallery in Paris was housed </i>in an impressive building, an elegant eighteenth-century <i>hotel particulier</i> on the Faubourg St. Honore. Collectors came there by appointment, through the enormous bronze doors into the courtyard. Straight ahead was the main gallery, to the left the offices of Simon de Suvery, the owner. And to the right was his daughter's addition to the gallery, the contemporary wing. Behind the house was a large elegant garden filled with sculptures, mainly Rodins. Simon de Suvery had been there for more than forty years. His father, Antoine, had been one of the most important collectors in Europe, and Simon had been a scholar of Renaissance paintings and Dutch masters before opening the gallery. Now he was consulted by museums all over Europe, held in awe by private collectors, and admired although often feared by all who knew him.<br> <br> Simon de Suvery was a daunting figure, tall, powerfully built, with stern features and dark eyes that pierced through you right to your soul. Simon had been in no hurry to get married. In his youth, he was too busy establishing his business to waste time on romance. At forty he had married the daughter of an important American collector. It had been a successful and happy union. Marjorie de Suvery had never involved herself directly in the gallery, which was well established before Simon married her. She was fascinated by it, and admired the work he showed. She loved him profoundly and had taken a passionate interest in everything he did. Marjorie had been an artist but never felt comfortable showing her work. She did genteel landscapes and portraits, and often gave them as gifts to friends. In truth, Simon had been affected but never impressed by her work. He was ruthless in his choices, merciless in his decisions for the gallery. He had a will of iron, a mind as sharp as a diamond, a keen business sense, and buried far, far beneath the surface, well concealed at all times, was a kind heart. Or so Marjorie said. Though not everyone believed her. He was fair to his employees, honest with his clients, and relentless in his pursuit of whatever he felt the gallery should have. Sometimes it took him years to acquire a particular painting or sculpture, but he never rested until it was his. He had pursued his wife, before their marriage, in much the same way. And once he had her, he kept her as a treasure--mostly to himself. He only socialized when he felt he had to, entertaining clients in one wing of the house.<br> <br> They decided to have children late in their marriage. In fact it was Simon's decision, and they waited ten years to have a child. Knowing how Marjorie longed for children, Simon had finally acceded to her wishes, and was only mildly disappointed when Marjorie gave birth to a daughter and not a son. Simon was fifty when Sasha was born, and Marjorie thirty-nine. Sasha instantly became the love of her mother's life. They were constantly together. Marjorie spent hours with her, chortling and cooing, playing with her in the garden. She nearly went into mourning when Sasha began school, and they had to be apart. She was a beautiful and loving child. Sasha was an interesting blend of her parents. She had her father's dark looks and her mother's ethereal softness. Marjorie was an angelic-looking blonde with blue eyes, and looked like a madonna in an Italian painting. Sasha had delicate features like her mother, dark hair and eyes like her father, but unlike both her parents, Sasha was fragile and small. Her father used to tease her benevolently and say that she looked like a miniature of a child. But there was nothing small about Sasha's soul. She had the strength and iron will of her father, the warmth and gentle kindness of her mother, and the directness she learned early on from her father. She was four or five before he took serious notice of her, and once he did, all he spoke to her about was art. In his spare time, he would wander through the gallery with her, identifying paintings and masters, showing her their work in art books, and he expected her to repeat their names and even spell them, once she was old enough to write. Rather than rebelling, she drank it all in, and retained every shred of information her father imparted. He was very proud of her. And ever more in love with his wife, who became ill three years after Sasha was born.<br> <br> Marjorie's illness was a mystery at first, and had all their doctors stumped. Simon secretly believed it was psychosomatic. He had no patience with illness or weakness, and thought that anything physical could be mastered and overcome. But rather than overcome it, Marjorie became weaker with time. It was a full year before they got a diagnosis in London, and a confirmation in New York. She had a rare degenerative disease that was attacking her nerves and muscles, and ultimately would cripple her lungs and heart. Simon chose not to accept the prognosis, and Marjorie was valiant about it, complaining little, doing whatever she could for as long as she was able, spending as much time as she had the strength for with her husband and daughter, and resting as much as possible in between. The disease never snuffed out her spirit, but eventually, as predicted, her body succumbed. She was bedridden by the time Sasha was seven, and died shortly after she turned nine. Despite all the doctors had told him, Simon was stunned. And so was Sasha. Neither of her parents had prepared Sasha for her mother's death. Sasha and Simon had both grown accustomed to Marjorie being interested in all they did, and participating in their lives, even while in bed. The sudden realization that she had disappeared from their world hit them both like a bomb, and fused Sasha and her father closer together than they had ever been. Other than the gallery, Sasha then became the focus of Simon's life.<br> <br> Sasha grew up eating, drinking, sleeping, loving art. It was all she knew, all she did, and all she loved, other than her father. She was as devoted to him as he was to her. Even as a child, she knew as much about the gallery, and its complicated and intriguing workings, as any of his employees. And sometimes he thought, even as a young girl, she was smarter about it, and far more creative than anyone he employed. The only thing that annoyed him, and he made no bones about it, was her ever increasing passion for modern and contemporary art. Contemporary work irritated him particularly, and he never hesitated to call it junk, privately or otherwise. He loved and respected the Great Masters, and nothing else.<br> <br> As her father had before her, Sasha attended the Sorbonne, and got a "license," a master's degree, in the history of art. And as she had promised her mother she would, she earned her PhD at Columbia in New York. Then she spent two years working as an intern at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which rounded out her education. During that time, she returned frequently to Paris, sometimes just for a weekend, and Simon visited her as often as possible in New York. It gave him an excuse to visit his clients, as well as museums and collectors in the States. All he really wanted to do was see Sasha, and he used any excuse to do so. What he wanted more than anything else was for Sasha to come home. He was irritable and impatient during her years in New York.<br> <br> The one thing Simon had never expected was the appearance of Arthur Boardman in Sasha's life. She met him the first week of her doctoral studies at Columbia. She was twenty-two at the time, and married him, despite her father's grumbling protests, within six months. At first, Simon was horrified at her marrying so young, and the only thing that mollified him, and made him consent to the marriage, was that Arthur assured his father-in-law that when Sasha was finished her studies and apprenticeship in New York, he would move to Paris with her and live there. Simon nearly made him sign it in blood. But even he couldn't resist seeing Sasha as happy as she was. Simon finally conceded that Arthur Boardman was a good man, and the right one for her.<br> <br> Arthur was thirty-two, ten years older than Sasha. He had gone to Princeton, and had an MBA from Harvard. He had a respectable position in a Wall Street investment bank, which conveniently had a Paris office. Early on in their marriage, he began lobbying to run it. Within a year, their son Xavier was born. Two years later, Tatianna arrived. In spite of that, Sasha never missed a beat with her studies. Miraculously, both her babies managed to arrive in the summer, right after she finished her classes. She hired a nanny to help her with them while she was in school and working at the museum. She had learned how to keep many balls in the air, while watching her father run the gallery when she was a child. She loved her busy life, and adored Arthur and her two children. And although Simon was a somewhat hesitant grandfather at first, he warmed to it quickly. They were enchanting children.<br> <br> Sasha spent every spare moment with them she could, singing the same songs and playing the same nursery games her mother had played with her. In fact, Tatianna looked so much like her maternal grandmother that it unnerved Simon at first, but as Tatianna grew older, he loved just sitting and watching her, and thinking of his late wife. It was like seeing her reborn as a little girl.<br> <br> True to his word, Arthur moved the entire family to Paris when Sasha finished her two-year internship at the Met in New York. The investment bank was literally giving him the Paris office to run, at thirty-six, and had full confidence in him, as did Sasha. She was going to be even busier there than she had been in New York, where she'd been working only part time at the museum, and spent the rest of her time caring for her children. In Paris, she was going to work at the gallery with her father. She was ready for it now. He had agreed to let her leave by three o'clock every day, so she could be with her children.

The Paratrisika Vivarana is one of the most fascinating but also most difficult texts of the Kashmir Saiva School, and of the mystical philosophical literature of India as a whole. It deals with Ultimate Reality (anuttara or para) and with the methods of realization, centred above all in the theory and practice of the mantra. Abhinavagupta displays here his great exegetical genius and presents a penetrating metaphysics of language, of the Word (vak) and its various stages in relation to consciousness. His language reflects in a luminous fashion the mystical experience contained in this text.</p><p>Dr. Jaideva Singh ( 1893-1986) : was a great scholar in musicology philosophy and Sanskrit.

Alongside Dick Francis and James Lee Burke, Parker is one of only three writers to be awarded the Edgar Award for Best Novel more than once. Parker lives with his family in Southern California.This mystery is a classic T. Jefferson Parker offering (circa 1991), revived by David Colacci&#39;s reading. Thanks to Colacci, it stands the test of time. A former deputy sheriff is called in to investigate his sister&#39;s murder after her body is found near a beach in Orange County, California. When a witness reports having seen a police vehicle near the scene around the time of the murder, law enforcement officers become suspect. Is the killer one of the ex-sheriff&#39;s former associates, or someone with another agenda? Colacci gives this story a brisk reading. His logical-sounding voice is pleasant. He differentiates his characters well and is especially convincing in the female and older male roles.

He's written for numerous TV shows, including <i>Roseanne</i>, <i>The Jeff Foxworthy Show</i>, <i>Becker</i>, <i>Titus</i>, and <i>Mind of the Married Man</i>&nbsp;and was a co-executive producer of the WB's <i>Blue Collar TV</i>. Shydner is the author of <i>Kicking Through the Ashes: My Life as a Stand-up in the 1980s Comedy Boom</i>. He is also the coauthor of a book on stand-up, <i>I Killed</i>. In the '80s, he made numerous TV appearances, including on&nbsp;<i>Late Night with David Letterman</i> and <i>The Tonight Show</i> with both Johnny Carson and Jay Leno.<br><br><b>Mark Schiff</b> is a stand-up comedian, actor, and the coauthor of a book on stand-up, <i>I Killed</i>. Jerry Seinfeld says that "Mark Schiff is one of the funniest, the brightest, the best stage comics I have ever seen." As a comedian, Schiff has been a headlining in all the major clubs and casinos across the United States for over 20 years. He has written for <i>Mad About You</i>, <i>Roseanne</i>, and <i>Blue Collar TV</i>, and is the author of four critically acclaimed plays.Some of the funniest&#x2014;and most outrageous&#x2014;stories a comedian has don't get told onstage. They're passed around after hours and derive from the bizarre intersection of travel, intoxicants and the colorful characters on the fringes of the comedy world. (A little poverty can't hurt&#x2014;the best stories from "top comics" often come from the early days.) In this collection, Ron Shock tells of being goaded by outlaw comic Bill Hicks into dropping acid before a show, infuriating the audience and escaping just in time. Jay Leno recounts how he accidentally left a groupie tied to her bed overnight&#x2014;and she loved it. Black comic Alonzo Bodden recalls ripping into a redneck from the stage and having audience members tell him later that his target ran the local Klan. Shydner, early in his career, performed regularly at a variety of bars around Washington, D.C., and found himself opening for a riled-up audience eager to see the Ramones. He suffered through a "beer shower," and one of the Ramones thought that was his act: human beer sponge. Jerry Seinfeld, in his foreword, calls comedy "one of the Great Jobs"; this volume makes for excellent bathroom reading&#x2014;and that's a compliment. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The "Little Boy" of the title is Ferlinghetti himself as a child, shuffled from his overburdened mother to his French aunt to foster childhood with a rich Bronxville family. Service in World War Two (including the D-Day landing), graduate work, and a scholar gypsy's vagabond life in Paris followed. These biographical reminiscences are interweaved with Allen Ginsberg-esque high energy bursts of raw emotion, rumination, reflection, reminiscence and prognostication on what we may face as a species on Planet Earth in the future. <i>Little Boy </i>is a magical font of literary lore with allusions galore, a final repository of hard-earned and durable wisdom, a compositional high wire act without a net (or all that much punctuation) and just a gas and an inspiration to read.</p><p>LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI was born in Yonkers, New York in 1919. Founder of the famed City Lights Booksellers and Publishers, he is an activist, painter, and author of numerous works of poetry, prose, and drama. His <i>A Coney Island of the Mind</i> is one of the bestselling poetry books of all time. Among his many honors are the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>' Robert Kirsch Award, the NBCC's Ivan Sandrof Award, and the ACLU's Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award. He is also a Commander of the French Order of Arts and Letters. He lives in San Francisco, close by to the bookstore he founded.<b>Excerpted from LITTLE BOY</b><br>Little Boy was quite lost. He had no idea who he was or where he had come from. He was with Aunt Emilie whom he loved very much. She had taken him in swaddling clothes from his mother who already had four sons and could not handle a fifth born a few months after his father died of a heart attack. His brother Harry aged twelve found their father dead on the back cellar steps of their little house just north of Van Cortland Park, Manhattan.&nbsp; "Poor Mom, no money, Pop dead," wrote Harry years later. His mother, Clemence Albertine Mendes-Monsanto, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Sephardic parents who had immigrated from Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands, where the family had been established for a very long time as wealthy planters until a collapse of the sugar market in the late 1890s impoverished them. The family had originally fled the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal but didn't arrive in the New World in steerage with nothing but their clothes. They arrived with all their possessions in steamer trunks, including candelabras, gold and jewels, and thus were able to set up as merchants and planters in St. Thomas where they soon had a great house on a hill with wide verandas looking down on the center of the town, and a family album showed them in broad-brimmed hats and black string ties. Saint Thomas was a Danish crown colony until America snatched it early in the 20th century, and the Monsantos had intermarried with the Danes as well as with French settlers, and there were many French relatives who visited and were visited in France. Clemence Albertine had a French mother of vague aristocratic origins, and she still spoke French. So it went that Clemence Albertine's uncle married Emilie from northern France, and thus it was that Emilie who had always wanted a child came and took the newborn Laurent from his distraught mother and bore him off to France by herself. Little Boy surmised many years later that her husband, Ludwig Monsanto, a professor of languages, and quite a bit older than Emilie, did not at his advanced age want to adopt a son, and thus left Emilie with little Laurent. And so thus it was that Tante Emilie took him back to her home town near Strasbourg (the same town&nbsp; the famous Captain Dreyfus was from) when he was perhaps two years old, and there they lived long enough for him to speak French before English, and his very first memory of existence was being held on a balcony above the boulevard where a parade was going by, and someone was waving his hand at the great parade with band music wafting up and strains of the "Marseillaise" echoing. And the next thing he remembered was that they were back in New York in a big high ceilinged apartment on the upper westside overlooking the Hudson and the Palisades across the great river and steamboats hooting their whistles and Aunt Emilie and Ludwig somehow back together again. He had a prickly beard when he embraced Little Boy, and the sun shone on them for a brief time until suddenly Uncle Ludwig was not there anymore, and this time for good. So then again it was himself and Aunt Emilie in the big elegant flat, but not for long, because she had no money, and soon a Health Department man came and took him away to an orphanage in Chappaqua New York because she had no money to buy him milk and the man said Little Boy would develop rickets. And there was much weeping when they took him away from Emilie, and so it was he stayed in that orphanage, and years later the only memory he had of it was having to eat undercooked tapioca pudding the kids called Cat's Eyes. Oh the time lost and no other memory of it, until a year later Aunt Emilie came and got him, and it was still the nineteen-twenties in America. And how he remembered her back then. She wore cloche hats and had her hair cut short like Louise Brooks and wore always the same elegant dress in the 1920&#x2019;s style, with low cut bosom and a long string of beads, and scent of eau-de cologne always about her. And of course it was not "always," except in Little Boy's memory, but it must have been her thread-bare elegance (well-hidden in her elegant spoken French) that got her a position as French governess to the 18-year-old daughter of Anna Lawrence Bisland and Presley Eugene Bisland in Bronxville New York where they lived in an ivy covered mansion not far from Sarah Lawrence College founded by Anna Lawrence's father. And so Aunt Emilie came and got him, and so began their life in a third floor room near the attic where steamer trunks with Cunard Line stickers on them shared space with old saddles and ancient bric-a-brac. But Little Boy remembered especially the dinners every night in the formal dining room with the big-boned Dutch butler who also served as chauffeur and was not used to butlering and juggled the serving dishes, while Tante Emilie conversed in French with beautiful daughter Sally, and the parents at opposite ends of the long table chiming in from time to time, or at least Madame Bisland did, for it was stylish back them to speak French and make grand tours of the Continent, especially Paris, and Aunt Emilie no doubt charmed them until a few months later she must have charmed Presley Bisland a little too much for Madame Bisland, and suddenly Aunt Emilie was gone from that house, and they told Little Boy that Emilie had gone away on her day off and had just never came back. Now, inasmuch as the Bislands had had a baby boy named Lawrence who died in infancy, it seemed an act of divine providence that they had now been provided with another Lawrence. And so it went, and Little Boy went on with them in the late 1920s in that fine mansion in Lawrence Park West Bronxville. But he was of school-age by then and they first sent him off to boarding school at Riverdale County School at Riverdale-on-Hudson of which Little Boy remembers nothing but a kind headmaster looking after him, the youngest boy in the school, and they had a summer camp in the Adirondacks where Little Boy learned to swim and tie knots and saw for the first time the first time the great woods, the huge straight pines, the shimmering lakes, the hidden streams and the light shining down on them, as in the first morning of the world. But this was all a brief idyll he would long remember, while between camp and school back at the mansion in Bronxville it was a very lonely life for Little Boy, with the nearest neighbor out of sight and no children of any age to play with, and there was only the grown-up Bislands who to Little Boy seemed very old, though perhaps they were only in their fifties, and he had a room in a wing of the house where great oaks leaned their branches over his windows, and the wind howled against the stone walls of the great house, but the wind was his companion in that room that seemed so distant from the rest of the house. It was only at mealtime when a dinner bell sounded that he descended to the family table to sit between Presley and Anna Bisland who talked to each other as if at a great distance. Now to describe each of them was a task for a writer like Charles Dickens, for indeed they were like Victorians in every way, each such a unique character of another age, at least to Little Boy. And Presley Eugene Bisland had been born into a noble but impoverished family in Natchez, Mississippi, a couple of decades after the American Civil War in which they had lost all but their great old mansion "Mount Repose.&#x201d; And Presley was the last son in a large family, and there was no inheritance for him. So at age 15 he took off to the West, hoping to strike it rich in Gold Rush California. He rode the Chisholm Trail on cattle drives, learned to break horses, and worked his way West as a cowboy. Somewhere in northern California he put his stake into a promising gold mine, only to lose every cent of it as the mine failed to pan out. Broke but still only 20, he made it to New York City where--through his family&#x2019;s connections--he was soon hobnobbing with rich distant cousins (everyone in the Old South being related to everyone else) and was invited to many parties on upper Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue. A handsome man he was indeed, and although he had only a lowly job in the Abbot Coin Counter Company, he was much in demand among the debutantes of that period, including the young Anna Lawrence whose family had a mansion on upper Fifth Avenue. It was there that a marriage was arranged (with or without love one never knew) between the very handsome well-spoken Presley and the plain but demure Anna Lawrence. So then after a grand marriage they settled in Bronxville, some fifty miles from the City. At that time, Bronxville was little more than open country, and Anna&#x2019;s father had bought up most of the acreage, planning a model town, with fine houses designed for artists and writers, its own water and electrical systems, etc, all owned originally by the Lawrence family. Into this fair enclave moved Presley and Anna early in the 20th century, and by the time Little Boy showed up they were already along in years, to Little Boy they were always very very old, too old in fact for a young child to make any kind of contact. But Little Boy did love Presley Bisland. He had a wit about him that sparkled through the courtly conversations with his wife, the stately old lady who wore black Victorian gowns, always with a diamond choker around her neck. Years later, when Little Boy came to know the writings of Mark Twain, he realized that Presley Bisland was cut out of the same cloth, with the same satiric humor as Twain, the same Southern background, even the same way of dressing. Presley had grown up in a household steeped in the classics, and had learned Latin at an early age. His library at Plashbourne (as their house was called) was full of Greek and Roman classics, as well as more modern writers like Lafcadio Hearn. The library was a small comfortable room just off the dining room paralleled in dark oak, with heavy easy chairs and nooks for reading. At the dinner table, Presley would address Little Boy with questions like &#x201c;Young man, you&#x2019;ve been to school &#x2014; who was Telemachus?&#x201d; or he would recite old chestnuts like &#x201c;Horatius at the Bridge,&#x201d; thundering out the rhymes, or &#x201c;The Charge of the Light Brigade&#x201d;, making Little Boy feel the flames of the battle with &#x201c;Cannons to the right of them, cannons to the left of them, into the valley of death rode the six hundred&#x201d; and the great phrase &#x201c;Someone had blundered!&#x201d; rang through the dinner-table air. Or he would give Little Boy silver dollars to recite some chestnut by heart at the table. And Anna Bisland would fade from their presence and there was only the gracious witty old man challenging the world. (Litlle Boy didn&#x2019;t know but perhaps she was pure Republican and he was Mark Twain) and if things ever seemed to be headed toward an argument, he usually answered &#x201c;Right or wrong, madam, you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; She perhaps believed in God, and he didn&#x2019;t. And when he was dying he forbid any kind of clergy to enter the house, but she snuck one in anyway, having a priest in an adjoining room mumble the last rites and then being spirited out the kitchen entrance. While all that Presley said was &#x201c;Out of the house tonight, dead or alive!&#x201d; Years later, reading Tolstoy, the grown Boy imagined Presley like Tolstoy leaving his death-bed for the train station.... And many years later, grown Boy realized how much he loved that man, and knew not how to express it. But he remembered how once in deep winter, with snow blanketing the formal gardens around the mansion, he happened to see the old man in his pajamas in the middle of the night stumbling out the front door into the deep snow and starting to stumble into the storm, and Little Boy running after him and bringing him back into the house, and the dear old man would have frozen to death out there if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Little Boy.</p><h2>Homebuilding and Woodworking in Colonial America (Illustrated Living History)</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Assuming that the pursuit of happiness should be a criterion in making public policy, he explores the enabling conditions of that pursuit (access to material resources, safety, self-respect prominent among them), then draws a fuzzy linkage between them and the concepts of challenge, competency and autonomy. His conclusion is that the pursuit of happiness is rooted in Edmund Burke's "little platoons" of work, family and community, and that the government, in order to encourage, nourish and protect these elemental functions, should keep interference to a minimum. He argues for "a radically more decentralized and limited government." Alas, Murray does not say how this might be brought about. First serial to National Review; Conservative Book Club dual main selection. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Murray's best seller, Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980, touted the virtues of small government. In this latest work, again sure to please conservatives and provoke liberals, he proposes that government not try to make people happy, but instead provide "enabling conditions" that ease their pursuit of happiness. These conditions notably include minimal welfare to provide merely the staples of life. Further attention to needy persons, he contends, should be provided by communities and local institutions. He acknowledges that his approach is especially difficult in poor inner cities with their alienation, impersonality, etc., but he nonetheless believes that typical governmental welfare only perpetuates poverty. A sophisticated treatment with potential broad appeal.

Then again, if Dana hadn&#x2019;t been sinking his thumbs into Roy&#x2019;s temples and mashing his face against the school-bus window, Roy might never have spotted the running boy. And the running boy is intriguing: he was running away from the school bus, carried no books, and&#x2013;here&#x2019;s the odd part&#x2013;wore no shoes. Sensing a mystery, Roy sets himself on the boy&#x2019;s trail. The chase introduces him to potty-trained alligators, a fake-fart champion, some burrowing owls, a renegade eco-avenger, and several extremely poisonous snakes with unnaturally sparkling tails.<br>Roy has most definitely arrived in Carl Hiaasen&#x2019;s Florida.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Roy Eberhardt is the new kid--again. This time around it's Trace Middle School in humid Coconut Grove, Florida. But it's still the same old routine: table by himself at lunch, no real friends, and thick-headed bullies like Dana Matherson pushing him around. But if it wasn't for Dana Matherson mashing his face against the school bus window that one day, he might never have seen the tow-headed running boy. And if he had never seen the running boy, he might never have met tall, tough, bully-beating Beatrice. And if he had never met Beatrice, he might never have discovered the burrowing owls living in the lot on the corner of East Oriole Avenue. And if he had never discovered the owls, he probably would have missed out on the adventure of a lifetime. Apparently, bullies do serve a greater purpose in the scope of the universe. Because if it wasn't for Dana Matherson...<p> In his first novel for a younger audience, Carl Hiaasen (<i>Basket Case</i>, etc.) plunges readers right into the middle of an ecological mystery, made up of endangered miniature owls, the Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House scheduled to be built over their burrows, and the owls' unlikely allies--three middle school kids determined to beat the screwed-up adult system. Hiaasen's tongue is firmly in cheek as he successfully cuts his slapstick sense of humor down to kid-size. Sure to be a hoot, er, hit with middle school mystery fans. (Ages 10 to 15) <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i></p>&#x201c;It seems unlikely that the master of noir-tinged, surrealistic black humor would write a novel for young readers. And yet, there has always been something delightfully juvenile about Hiaasen&#x2019;s imagination; beneath the bent cynicism lurks a distinctly 12-year-old cackle. In this thoroughly engaging tale of how middle schooler Roy Eberhardt, new kid in Coconut Cove, learns to love South Florida, Hiaasen lets his inner kid run rampant, both the subversive side that loves to see grown-ups make fools of themselves and the righteously indignant side, appalled at the mess being made of our planet. The story is full of offbeat humor, buffoonish yet charming supporting characters, and genuinely touching scenes of children enjoying the wildness of nature.

UP.</p><p>"This is an outstanding contribution to the military history of a very important and little-known event in the campaign on the Eastern Front. That this major setback should have been so concealed from the outside world is characteristic of Soviet censorship; but the depth in which Glantz has studied the whole operation from High Command level to company or platoon using the widest range of source material deserves the highest praise. Also significant is Glantz's placement of Operation Mars alongside the much better-known Stalingrad battle (Operation Uranus) in Soviet political-strategic planning. Glantz's evidence is impressive, his conclusions totally convincing, and the actual military detail unrivaled in the literature. A truly important work."--Malcolm Macintosh, author of <i>Juggernaut: A History of Soviet Armed Forces</i> <p>"A very important book that radically challenges the 'received wisdom' about Stalingrad, the full significance of which cannot be grasped without understanding the role of Operation Mars. That story has remained largely unknown or unexplored for half a century, systematically concealed in Soviet historiography and deliberately misrepresented by Zhukov himself. Glantz's indispensable account, fundamentally important for a proper understanding of the Soviet-German front in late 1942, rescues Operation Mars from such terrible oblivion."--John Erickson, author of <i>The Road to Stalingrad</i> </p><p>"Redressing a major imbalance in the historical record, Glantz does a remarkable job of unearthing the Soviet side of Operation Mars.

Set in the backwoods South of the 1940s, Gay's tale is populated with a colorful array of types familiar to readers of William Faulkner, Cormac McCarthy, and other practitioners of that particular brand of larger-than-life literature that seems to thrive south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Though the types might be familiar, Gay does an impressive job of making them his own, each with his or her distinctive, fully human qualities that transcend the roles they play as bootlegger, town drunk, or even hero. <p> The story opens when Dallas Hardin ("Old Nick," according to one character--"or whatever he's goin' by now") comes to town and wrests away home, wife, and whiskey still from the seriously ill Thomas Hovington. Only in a Southern novel could such an event be preceded by the inexplicable opening of a brimstone-scented pit near the victim's house without the reader even blinking an eye. Enter young Nathan Winer, hired by Hardin to build a honky-tonk. Winer starts out thinking he can earn his wage while steering clear of his employer's evil ways, but it soon becomes apparent that he can't--especially after he falls in love with Tom Hovington's daughter, now Hardin's stepdaughter, Amber Rose. Having given his heart, Nathan has taken the first inexorable step towards a final, deadly confrontation with the devil. </p><p> If Gay's themes are big--nothing less than the battle between good and evil--and his metaphors drawn unabashedly from that old-time religion, his novel is nonetheless firmly grounded in the flesh-and-bone world--sometimes nightmarishly so. There is a <i>lot</i> of blood spilt over the course of this novel, in myriad ways and in graphic detail. Indeed, one quality that <i>The Long Home</i> shares with most of Cormac McCarthy's work is that it is definitely not for the faint-hearted. But Gay balances the horror with moments of true beauty, and his novel is undeniably compelling. Enjoy it for its many strengths and for its promise of a bright literary future <i>--Sheila Bright</i></p>William Gay lives in Howenwald, Tennessee.

They are people with the courage to trust their own judgments, conceiving of living space as something which must reflect their personal uniqueness, even to the point of working as a sacred mandala for energy, a place for achieving an integration with a larger harmony. <br><br>Although there is much practical information here, especially with regard to planning and getting ready to build, and on building codes, this book is more about the personal odysseys of these 'space people' as interviewed and studied by this woman who calls herself 'River.'<br><br>Reading her notes as she pulled this book together, hearing her interview and collect and wonder, sharing her anger and anguish and through it all knowing some of her joy at the rightness and adventure inherent in this form of reclaiming control over her life has fully convinced me that, for some at least, 'breaking free' or 'dropping out' or 'going to the country' is anything but an escape. Rather it is an energetic, searching, experimental joining of the central issue of our time: the incredibly difficult task of learning to 'choose' a culture, a new pattern of living to emerge among us, that does not rip off the planet or any of her inhabitants. This, at base, is what these strange, sometimes rather bizarre houses and their builders are all about.

These cookies&#x2014;-which replicate the flavors and textures of a brownie in a meringue--like cookie that's miraculously crisp on the outside and gooey in the middle&#x2014;-were the invention of the late, great baker Sal Picinich (who passed away while I was writing this book) and they-re pretty ingenious.</p> <p>What impresses me about these cookies is the complex, deeply satisfying result achieved with just a handful of ingredients: egg whites, sugar, cocoa, and nuts. The batter looks like an unholy, goopy-gooey mess. When you make these, you might even think you did something wrong&#x2014;-how could it transform into something appetizing? Your doubt might even be increased by the fact that these can only be spooned onto your baking sheet; the dough is too sticky for a pastry bag and too messy to work with by hand.</p> <p>But trust me: Once these get into the oven, something magical happens and these ugly ducklings turn into perfect little swans&#x2014;-and everybody will love the way they mimic the flavor and texture of brownies. It's a cookie to die for.</p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <p><b>Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <p></p><li>3 extra-large egg whites</li><p></p> </ul> <ul> <p></p><li>1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li><p></p> </ul> <ul> <p></p><li>1 1/2 cups powdered (10X) sugar</li><p></p> </ul> <ul> <p></p><li>1 1/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder </li><p></p> </ul> <ul> <p></p><li>1 1/2 cups unsalted raw walnut halves</li><p></p> </ul> <br> <p><b>Instructions</b></p> <p>1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F.</p> <p>2. Put the egg whites and lemon juice in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment. (Be sure the bowl is immaculately clean; see "Egg Whites," page 56.) Whip on low speed for 2 minutes, then on maximum speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.</p> <p>3. Sift the sugar and cocoa powder into the bowl together, then fold into the batter with a rubber spatula until the batter is smooth and shiny. Fold in the walnuts, until they are well coated with the batter.</p> <p>4. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper, using nonstick spray or a dab of butter in each corner to glue the paper in place. Drop heaping tablespoons of dough 1/2 inch apart, being sure to include about the same number of walnuts (3 or 4) in each one.</p> <p>5. Bake until the outside has crisped and the bottom starts to pull away from the parchment paper, 15 to 20 minutes.</p> <p>6. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven. As soon as the clusters can be moved, use a spatula to transfer them to a rack and let them cool.</p> <p>Enjoy the cookies right away, or store when completely cool in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.</p> <br> <p><b>Sifting</b></p> <p>I sift ingredients for two reasons: (1) To be sure dry ingredients aren't too compacted; sifting helps ensure a lighter result in the baked good being made. (2) To better combine two or more dry ingredients that will be added to a recipe at the same time. This is especially important when you are using leavening agents such as baking powder and baking soda&#x2014;-you want those strong-acting ingredients to be as evenly distributed as possible to ensure an even result across the entire baked good. (All of that said, in some cookie recipes I don't call for sifting because the dough gets mixed enough that the ingredients can't help being evenly distributed.)</p>Buddy Valastro is the star of TLC&#x2019;s hit series <i>Cake Boss</i> and <i>Next Great Baker</i> and Food Network&#x2019;s <i>Buddy vs. Duff</i>, as well as the author of four cookbooks, including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Cake Boss</i> and<i> Baking with the</i> <i>Cake Boss.</i> He&nbsp;is the owner of&nbsp;Carlo&#x2019;s Bake Shop and lives with his wife and four children in New Jersey.</p><h2>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About God: But Were Afraid To Ask: The Jesus Edition</h2><p>We all have questions about Jesus, but very few of us get the answers we&#x2019;re looking for&#x2014;if the answers even exist! Do they? Where (in heaven&#x2019;s name) do you go to find out? New York Times bestselling author Eric Metaxas understands how hard it can be to get hard truths, and that&#x2019;s why he is writing this hilarious, entertaining guide to the most influential single Person to have ever lived on the face of the earth. Like his previous books in this style, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About God is a book that takes questions about the Son of God seriously enough to get silly- where appropriate. Metaxas covers questions about Jesus&#x2019; life -Did He live at all?-, His death -If He truly was the Son of God, why did He have to die?-, His resurrection -Did Jesus really come back after death?-, and much more. Apologetics has never been so much fun!</p><p>You don&#x2019;t often hear &#x201c;Buddha!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Muhammad!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Confucius!&#x201d; when someone is really steamed. Why? What about Jesus is so provocative that people yell His name when they hammer their thumbs or ding their bumpers? What makes Jesus so intriguing, so disturbing, that we&#x2019;re still talking about Him more than 2,000 years after He rocked the Sanhedrin? (Not sure what the Sanhedrin is? Not to worry. See inside.) New York Times bestselling author Eric Metaxas thinks that life&#x2019;s most important questions are best answered honestly, thoughtfully and with a generous helping of levity. So if you&#x2019;ve got questions about Jesus (was He real?), His death (why did He die?), His teachings (what&#x2019;s with all the stories?) or the resurrection (seriously?), then crack open this book and start your inquiry.&nbsp;<b>ERIC METAXAS</b> is the New York Times bestselling author of Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery.

From the late eighteenth to the late nineteenth century, newspapers were the republic's central political institutions, working components of the party system rather than commentators on it.</p><p> <i>The Tyranny of Printers </i>narrates the rise of this newspaper-based politics, in which editors became the chief party spokesmen and newspaper offices often served as local party headquarters. Beginning when Thomas Jefferson enlisted a Philadelphia editor to carry out his battle with Alexander Hamilton for the soul of the new republic (and got caught trying to cover it up), the centrality of newspapers in political life gained momentum after Jefferson's victory in 1800, which was widely credited to a superior network of papers. Jeffrey L. Pasley tells the rich story of this political culture and its culmination in Jacksonian democracy, enlivening his narrative with accounts of the colorful but often tragic careers of individual editors.</p></p><p>This book presents a side of early American politics not told by Joseph Ellis or David McCullough. Here you can find the stories of the journalists who were jailed by the now-cuddly John Adams or beaten by his supporters. Reader of Richard Rosenfeld&#39;s &#34;American Aurora&#34; should particularly enjoy this book.<p>Jeffrey L.

Part-time librarian and frequent amateur investigator Roe Teagarden has good reason to ask herself this question when the remains of one of the Lawrenceton, Georgia police department&#39;s finest catapults into her flower bed one beautiful sunny morning. Roe&#39;s friend and bodyguard, the long-legged, bikini-clad Angel Youngblood, is mowing the grass and Roe is reclining on a lounger when a small red-and-white plane flies low overhead and drops its unlikely debris more or less at Roe&#39;s feet. Roe&#39;s husband of two years, wealthy businessman Martin Bartell, immediately wonders if the killer chose his dumping place to send some kind of message to Roe. And the mystery deepens when two federal agents arrive in town to investigate the murder.

At an average low of -16 degrees Fahrenheit, the winters may be unpleasantly frigid, but the light shows are always glorious! </p><p>Acclaimed author Debbie S. Miller details the sunsets, twilight, alpenglow, diamond dust, and other quietly beautiful phenomena that color "the Land of the Midnight Sun," describing each animal's activities in both the warm and cold seasons.

In Fairbanks, AK, Miller begins with the 21 hours and 49 minutes of daylight on June 21, then follows the light's diminution month by month to the winter solstice and its daylight of 3 hours and 43 minutes to its gradual swelling back to the summer solstice. Her brief text includes not only lyrical messages about light and its partner, darkness, but also references to the reaction of wildlife to the waxing and waning: the migration of birds and caribou, the hibernation of bears, the changing coat of the Arctic hare. Wrapped about this unfamiliar (to many of us) swirl of seasons of light are Van Zyle's superb and quietly beautiful acrylic paintings, which capture both light and dark in perfect harmony with the text. A map of Alaska, an introductory note, and an excellent glossary are included. Team this bit of loveliness and imagination with Ellen Jackson's delightful quartet Summer Solstice (2001), Autumn Equinox (2000), Winter Solstice (1994), and Spring Solstice (2002, all Millbrook); encourage children to get out a calendar, pen, paper, thermometer, and clock and jubilantly record the radiant pattern of light in their own little corners of the world.

The accessible and informative entries convey the significance of Greek mythology and its place at the core of Western culture. They evoke the majesty, as well as the all-too-human foibles, of the Greek deities and their acolytes.

The Bible is full of nothing but contradictions." </p><p> Questions and comments like these compelled Andrew Wommack to introduce the profoundly simple concepts found in this book. Often, human perspective and the mechanics of Christianity eclipse The True Nature of God - the God who wants nothing more than to share an intimate friendship with His children.

While many of the chapters read like lessons in biology, plenty of parents will find useful tidbits and reflections from this father of two. <p> Gurian emphatically agrees with Deborah Sichel's (<i>Women's Moods</i>) idea of "A woman's biology is the cornerstone of her mental health." He elaborates on this theory throughout his discussion on the physical changes in childhood and adolescence. This concept certainly holds some validity, but there's a fine line from here to "biology is destiny." Some readers may find Gurian crosses that line with his claims of "brain pruning" and insistence about hormones: "they don't just change a girl into a woman, they are, to a great extent, the woman herself." </p><p> Others find his recommendations on hormonal treatments to be a literal lifesaver, and the book is peppered with positive anecdotes from his own life and families encountered in his training sessions. Important issues like self-esteem, eating disorders, and sexual experimentation are all addressed, along with the role of the father and "the absolute sanctity of motherhood." Gurian offers a somewhat narrow path as a guide through your daughter's adolescence, but if nothing else, this book will provide a solid background in the physical aspects of her growth. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>Michael Gurian</b> is a therapist, educator, and bestselling author.

It is summer, and Eleanor's grandmother is sending her to Camp Wallumwahpuck. Though excited at first, she quickly finds herself homesick, as the only camp food she can stomach are the salads and rolls, and her bunk bed is near spiderwebs. Not only that, but she is stuck in the baby swimming group. Eleanor is mortified and miserable and just wants to go home. Of course, it is not long before she finds herself making friends, taking care of an adorable goat, and learning to swim. Maybe camp is not as awful as she thought. Eleanor is a likable character, and kids will relate to her unease at being far away from her family. The ending wraps up nicely, as the story is more about how she copes with a situation that is less than ideal and does not involve Eleanor having a complete change of heart.

Recorded in one night, in the middle of a turbulent year in his life, the music marked a departure from Dylan's socially-conscious folk songs and began his evolution toward other directions.</p><p>During the years they spent together, few people outside of Dylan's immediate family were closer than Victor Maymudes, who was Dylan's tour manager, personal friend, and travelling companion from the early days in 1960s Greenwich Village through the late 90's. Another Side of Bob Dylan recounts landmark events including Dylan's infamous motorcycle crash; meeting the Beatles on their first US tour; his marriage to Sara Lownds, his romances with Suze Rotolo, Joan Baez, and others; fellow travelers Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Wavy Gravy, Dennis Hopper, The Band, The Traveling Wilburys, and more; memorable concerts, and insights on Dylan's songwriting process.</p><p>On January 26th, 2001, after recording more than 24 hours of taped memories in preparation for writing this book, Victor Maymudes suffered an aneurysm and died.

He died in January, 2001.</p><p>JACOB MAYMUDES is a writer, director and visual effects supervisor working for the Mill in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>A Brief History</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Altogether my father recorded twenty-four hours of audio chronicling his relationship with Bob Dylan, Dennis Hopper, Joan Baez, Ramblin&#x2019; Jack Elliott, Wavy Gravy, David Crosby, Tom Petty, the rest of the Traveling Wilburys and a few others who made up his inner circle of friends.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s interesting and fortunate, in my opinion, that he chose this process for writing rather than something more traditional. If he only wrote what he was thinking, I believe there would be less of a chance of those pages being preserved over a decade later. Everything in this box in front of me seems brand new, aside from the deteriorating foam attached to the microphone.</p> <p>There are several reasons he chose to record his voice rather than write. The simplest reason: My father always claimed he wasn&#x2019;t a writer and said on occasion it wasn&#x2019;t his preferred method of communicating. He was a conversationalist, an intelligent man with street smarts and a firm grasp of politics and current events. In his teens and twenties his education took place in coffee shops and music venues, not in the classroom. Nowhere is this more evident than in the opening paragraph of his term paper, dated 1956:</p> <p>In the following paper you will find that I have just about broken all the rules of proper grammar. For this I apologize. I realize I could do without doing this, but I do not feel that I can express myself to my satisfaction unless I write the way I talk.</p> <p>Victor grew up with a sense of rebellion, most likely influenced by his parents&#x2019; leadership of unions, social groups and religious fraternal orders. He was witness to them standing up for what they believed in, even when those beliefs ran contrary to the law. He adopted a mentality that he expressed to me when I was a child by saying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a family of outlaws, not criminals, and that&#x2019;s a very important distinction. In order to do what&#x2019;s right, sometimes you have to live outside the law.&#x201d; As a nine-year-old child my interpretation of this was empowering, though sometimes in a way my mother surely regretted.</p> <p>How his parents, my grandparents, indoctrinated him is complex and extends back hundreds of years. Both died from old age before I was a teenager, so with extensive research I&#x2019;ve been able to piece together their history and plausible explanations for their ability to lead and protest.</p> <p>Abe and Goldie Maymudes moved to New York City in 1920 from Brock, Poland, a small town located on the Bug River. The river was used heavily in the early 1900s to ship lumber from Poland to Germany. Both of Victor&#x2019;s parents lived in the same town as kids, but were only acquaintances. As teenagers they belonged to a Jewish organization for young boys and girls called Maccabee by the Germans and Herzliya by the Jews. Abe was the leader of the boys&#x2019; section, Goldie the leader of the girls. Herzliya was a political and social club, embodying the spirit of the Russian Revolution at the time. Goldie and Abe were fifteen and sixteen respectively. The club was ultimately dissolved when Poland went to war against Russia in 1920. Goldie said in an interview in 1989:</p> <p>The First World War really shook up the society. The youngsters went out from the yeshivas and from the <i>chedorim</i> [religious schools], and they went on to more worldly things. They went to learn; Maymudes [Abe] went to a German school for boys. We all went into regular government city schools to learn the language and to become more worldly people. This was a great change in our life. We stepped outside of the boundaries of our parents keeping us in their religious form.</p> <p>Both Goldie and Abe came from extremely religious families. Goldie&#x2019;s grandfather on her father&#x2019;s side, my great-great-grandfather, was a <i>dayen</i>, a student of law and a rabbi. As the <i>dayen</i> he was the leader of the village, Brock. As for Abe, his lineage has been traced back thirteen generations to the Spanish Middle Ages, when the family name supposedly changed from Maimonides to Maymudes. This name change vaguely suggests the Maymudes lineage is connected to Moses Maimonides, the preeminent medieval Sephardic Jewish philosopher, astronomer and one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the Middle Ages.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve personally had a hard time believing this connection through our bloodline, but I admit the possibility despite lacking any hard proof. Maimonides&#x2019;s only son, Avraham, continued his father&#x2019;s legacy as a great scholar. As the history is written, the office of Nagid, the Jewish governing power, was presided over by the Maimonides family for four consecutive generations until the end of the fourteenth century.</p> <p>Abe and Goldie&#x2019;s parents, my great-grandparents, fell on hard times after World War One. Work with decent-paying wages was hard to come by, so separately the families decided to move to New York City on the same day on the same ship in 1920. Abe&#x2019;s family, having less money, bought tickets in second class, while Goldie&#x2019;s family traveled in first class. Abe remembered seeing her once on the ship in passing. They were still only friends.</p> <p>Once in New York the families both joined a left-wing Jewish organization. One afternoon during a boat outing on the Hudson River, Abe finally approached Goldie for a date. Within the next five years they would be married, and by 1930 Goldie had given birth to August, Victor&#x2019;s older brother.</p> <p>During this time in the early 1920s, they both taught classes for the Workmen&#x2019;s Circle, a Yiddish language&#x2013;oriented Jewish-American fraternal organization committed to social justice. In 1922 there was a contentious political rift in the organization&#x2019;s top brass, which led to the creation of the leftist International Workers Order (IWO). The IWO was established in 1930, promoting leftist, progressive values and operating as a fraternal mutual aid organization and insurance provider. Members were provided with low-cost health and life insurance, as well as medical and dental clinics. The organization also supported foreign-language newspapers, cultural and educational activities and operated a summer camp and cemeteries for its members. The Jewish Section of the IWO was one of thirteen other sections, including Italian, Ukrainian, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, English and other language branches. The Jewish/Yiddish branch was the largest and, in Los Angeles, one of the most important Jewish organizations in the first half of the twentieth century. The IWO at its peak had over two hundred thousand members, of which one third were Jewish. The Jewish section of the International Workers Order was also referred to as the Jewish People&#x2019;s Fraternal Order (JPFO).</p> <p>In 1934, over a decade into their employment with the JPFO/IWO, Abe and Goldie moved across the country and transferred to teaching in the Los Angeles branch. In 1935, Goldie gave birth to Victor at the Los Angeles County Hospital.</p> <p>The following year Abe was promoted from teaching to the president of the Los Angeles chapter of the JPFO. His organizational and political role as a teen was resurrected there. After the promotion they bought their first home in Rosemead, California, about twenty-five miles east of Los Angeles. On May 31, 1946, Goldie gave birth to Victor&#x2019;s younger sister, Zicel Maymudes.</p> <p>When Victor was fifteen, Abe was transferred back to New York to become president of the entire organization. At the same time the Special Committee on Un-American Activities of the U.S. House of Representatives investigated the JPFO for what they declared was a &#x201c;huge patronage machine furnishing positions for a host of Communist functionaries, who serve as the party&#x2019;s controlling commissars within the organization.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Los Angeles developments followed the pattern of the nationwide McCarthy-era witch-hunt. The IWO was placed on the U.S. Attorney General&#x2019;s list of &#x201c;subversive&#x201d; organizations on December 5, 1947, and on December 14, 1950, the New York State Insurance Department moved to liquidate the Order on grounds that its significant cash reserves, far beyond what commercial insurers were required to maintain, would be turned over to the enemy in the event of war with the Soviet Union.</p> <p>This happened despite Abe using his influence to raise over four hundred thousand dollars from the sale of war bonds to his organization&#x2019;s members, an act that he was congratulated for in a letter from Major Prayski, chairman of the War Savings Staff of the Treasury Department. He was informed that the army was naming a heavy bomber &#x201c;the Spirit of Boyle Heights&#x201d; to honor the JPFO/IWO, which maintained its Los Angeles offices in Boyle Heights. I assume naming a heavy bomber after a group that has secular and Communist ideology is a rare occasion for the United States military.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>After a four-year heated struggle, the Jewish Community Council (which became the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles in 1959) ostracized the JPFO from the Jewish community, froze the JPFO&#x2019;s assets and worked toward its dissolution. The Los Angeles Community Council also began a process of halting support for the other Jewish community centers in Los Angeles&#x2014;the Soto-Michigan Community Center and the City Terrace Cultural Center. Within a few years, not only was the JPFO destroyed, but so too were the other most important Jewish cultural institutions in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Abe left the organization in 1950 and moved the family to Pacoima near Los Angeles. As the former president of a suspected Communist front, finding new employment was tricky for Abe during the McCarthy era. With the family in a desperate spot financially, Goldie took to raising chickens and selling eggs to keep the family afloat.</p> <p>From Victor&#x2019;s birth to age sixteen, he was witness to a committed social and political philosophy. His parents cared about their community and actively protected it by educating others, leading demonstrations and offering social services. What the government labeled as illegal was actually a peaceful organization, patriotic to the United States and nourishing positive growth in their communities. They were defined as outlaws while doing what they felt was morally right and just.</p> <p>In 1951 the family moved to Canoga Park to start a larger chicken farm. Sixteen-year-old Victor took an interest in carpentry and helped construct a large-scale chicken coop for the family. This type of construction and carpentry intrigued him and, upon his mother&#x2019;s suggestion, he decided to make it his trade. In a college essay, Victor recounted that he was able to find construction work nearby at the rate of three fifty per hour and felt on top of the world. After a few weeks of work, he claimed to have more money than he knew what to do with.</p> <p>When Victor turned eighteen in 1953, he was sent a draft letter and was required to attend an evaluation. His political and social ideology was heavily influenced by his parents&#x2019; role as community organizers, and the idea of war or fighting for causes that contradicted his beliefs was something he would rail against. He attended the evaluation stoned and when asked if he was willing to shoot the enemy, he responded with, &#x201c;If you give me a gun, I&#x2019;ll shoot everyone around me. Including you.&#x201d; His aggressive response wasn&#x2019;t born of inherent madness; it was a calculated statement targeted at failing the psych profile. He was deemed unfit for the draft and let go.</p> <p>By 1955 a twenty-year-old Victor was entering the new culture of beatniks, music, art and drugs that Jack Kerouac would capture in <i>On the Road</i>, which was published in 1956. He and his friend Herb Cohen decided to open a coffee shop. They would become partners in the traditional sense; Herb would manage the business, and Victor would design and build the look and feel of the cafe. That year, in all of the city, there wasn&#x2019;t a single counterculture hangout or coffee shop. What they were planning was the first of its kind for Los Angeles: a home for live music and poetry; a reading room with a collection of hip books and ample space to play chess. It would quickly become a place where rebellion could thrive.</p> <p>They found a perfect location in the heart of Hollywood at 8907 Sunset Blvd, the center of the Sunset Strip. Together they named the cafe: the Unicorn. For marketing they put posters up in liberal bookstores, music venues and any place that had a sense of hipness and a taste for folk music. Their posters were hand drawn with large hippie-looking characters playing guitars and sipping espressos. Swirling lines intertwined with slogans such as, &#x201c;Where casual craznicks climb circular charcoal curbs for cool calculated confabulations&#x201d; and &#x201c;Espresso espression sessions on the patio.&#x201d; The cafe was painted entirely black inside and pictures of nude women hung upside down on the walls. They were defining what hip was and they nailed it. Once the place was built, Victor would reach out to musician friends and poets to book performances at the cafe.</p> <p>When they opened the doors, the Unicorn was instantly a hit. Queues would stretch down the street and around the block. They had tapped right into something bigger than themselves, a cultural divide precipitated by the strict mentality of the 1950s. What they created didn&#x2019;t happen by chance, it was built by the entropy of a jaded youth reaching out for something to identify with. My father told me on many occasions about the feeling in the air at this time, as if everyone was waiting for something to happen. Some change of consciousness, like a giant wave that starts way out in the middle of the ocean. You know it&#x2019;s coming, you just don&#x2019;t know when it&#x2019;ll arrive or how big it&#x2019;s going to be. The venues for this revolution were being built, like the Unicorn; Victor would say they just needed a figurehead, a voice. They were waiting for someone to show up on the scene, someone who could reach across the oceans and connect people.</p> <p>Marlon Brando, Dennis Hopper, Odetta, Peter Fonda and many other Hollywood A-listers would come to the Unicorn and hang out. Victor came up with a novel idea of putting brandy extract in lattes, which then became the must-have trendy drink of 1958. Worried parents would call in, asking why their teenage daughters and sons smelled like whiskey after an evening at the cafe. Police would routinely stop in and check for alcohol in the drinks but to their dismay couldn&#x2019;t find any, despite the strong odor of whiskey.</p> <p>In the evenings Lenny Bruce would come by after working at Duffy&#x2019;s Gaieties and stage his own special comedy shows. Bruce&#x2019;s rise to the status of cultural icon began in the mid-1950s. The iconoclastic edginess that would be his trademark was developed at the Unicorn and other clubs on the Sunset Strip. In his autobiography, <i>How to Talk Dirty and Influence People</i>, Bruce describes the importance of the freedom that came from venues like this:</p> <p>Four years working in clubs&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what really made it for me&#x2014;every night: doing it, doing it, doing it, getting bored and doing different ways, no pressure on you, and all the other comedians are drunken bums who don&#x2019;t show up, so I could try anything.</p> <p>Police were troubled by Bruce&#x2019;s use of the word &#x201c;cocksucker,&#x201d; and his use of the phrase &#x201c;to come&#x201d; (in a sexual sense) to the point that he was arrested for a performance at the Unicorn.</p> <p>Herb and Victor also hired the &#x201c;hippest&#x201d; waitresses. They were referred to as being as mean as snakes, women fallen from grace. Waitresses would stare you down with menacing glares and have little appetite for wasting their time with your service. Departing from the chivalry of the 1950s, when service was king, these unruly waitresses were trend-setters in their own right. Once, Steve McQueen was accidentally d...</p></p><h2>A Lion Called Christian: The True Story of the Remarkable Bond Between Two Friends and a Lion</h2><p>In 2008 an extraordinary two-minute film clip appeared on YouTube and immediately became an international phenomenon. It captures the moving reunion of two young men and their pet lion Christian, after they had left him in Africa with Born Free s George Adamson to introduce him into his rightful home in the wild.A Lion Called Christian tells the remarkable story of how Anthony Ace Bourke and John Rendall, visitors to London from Australia in 1969, bought the boisterous lion cub in the pet department of Harrods. For several months, the three of them shared a flat above a furniture shop on London s King s Road, where the charismatic and intelligent Christian quickly became a local celebrity, cruising the streets in the back of a Bentley, popping in for lunch at a local restaurant, even posing for a fashion advertisement. But the lion cub was growing up fast and soon even the walled church garden where he went for exercise</p><p><p>ANTHONY &#x201c;ACE&#x201d; BOURKE is one of Australia&#x2019;s leading art curators. He lives in Sydney. JOHN RENDALL is a member of the Royal Geographic Society and a trustee of the George Adamson Trust. He divides his time between London and Sydney.</p>This book about two Australians who buy a pet lion they name Christian at Harrods in London was published in 1971. It has been updated and republished since the phenomenal online success of a video about the reunion between the lion and the men after the cat had been rehabilitated by George Adamson (BORN FREE) and released into the wilds of Africa. It&#39;s a warm, loving story that retains its relevance decades after the events. John Lee is an able reader. He uses just enough of an accent to give the Australian setting authenticity, but not so much that it interferes with the story, especially for American listeners. The pace of the text is lively and engaging.

I was broken by the choices I had made. Stubborn and willful, I had followed my own path, and now I would have to face the consequences. I had caused pain for my children and loved ones. I feared I had embarrassed my parents. It seemed I had wrecked my world. The shame was almost unbearable. I had driven sixteen hours from South Florida, stopping to pick up my youngest daughter at boarding school, and now I was tired and anxious. The familiarity of my childhood environs did little to subdue my fears. The February mountain air was crisp and clean. The bare trees---maple, poplar, and oak---lining the drive up to my parents&#39; house afforded a view this time of year, but I was too absorbed to notice. What would my life be like now? I had gone against everyone&#39;s advice. My family had warned me. They had tried to stop me. But I had not listened. I needed to do what was best for me, I had told them. And now my life was a shambles. I was a failure in my own eyes and certainly would be in the eyes of others when they learned what &#39;Billy Graham&#39;s daughter&#39; had done. I feared I had humiliated those I held dearest. How would I be able to face them? Driving up the mountain, my fears multiplied. Adrenaline kept my foot on the gas. I felt my hands grip the steering wheel. My mind was spinning. I tried to remember my mother&#39;s insistent tone from our phone conversation a few days earlier: &#39;Come home,&#39; she had urged. I was desperate when I called her. I told her of my mistake and was trying to piece together a plan when she interjected with the voice of a loving, protective parent. But how would she and my father respond when they saw me? What would they say to me? Would they say, &#39;You&#39;ve made your bed; now lie in it&#39;? Would they condemn me? Would they reject me? Despise me? They had every right. As I rounded the last bend in the driveway, Daddy came into view. He was standing in the paved area where visitors usually park. Rolling the car to a stop, I took a deep breath and prepared to greet my father. I turned off the ignition, opened the car door, and stepped onto the driveway. Then I looked up--- Daddy was already at my side. Before I could say a word, he took me into his arms and said, &#39;Welcome home.&#39; IS THERE A BROKEN HEART IN YOUR PEW? I know what it&#39;s like to sit in the pew with a broken heart. For years I sat in church with my fears, doubts, and disappointments, thinking I was alone in my condition. Those around me seemed to have it all together. They looked so &#39;spiritual.&#39; Did they not struggle as I did? Was I the only one whose dreams had fallen to pieces? Was I the only one who had blown it? Was I the only one depressed and feeling beyond hope? To protect myself and to fit in, I masked my shortcomings and dared not whisper my failures. I worked hard to create the impression that my life was neat and orderly. I knew the posture and language well---and I carried it off. Few knew or guessed the truth. But I was miserable. Perhaps you too have walked this tightrope. You are hurting. Something in your life is causing you great distress and unspeakable pain. But you cover it over with a smile. Perhaps you are depressed or feel inadequate, unable to cope with life. Perhaps you have been rejected by someone close to you. Maybe your spouse has walked out. Maybe your child has run away from home. Maybe you are lonely or struggling with an addiction. Overwhelmed, you want to scream. You need to scream. But it is a silent scream. Because you are afraid to let anyone know the depth of your pain. Have you experienced this kind of pressure? Are you experiencing it now? Are you broken and worried you have nowhere safe to open your heart? Do you fear you may never recover from the blows life has dealt you? Is it hard for you to imagine being normal again? Are you saddled with shame and guilt, or resentment and anger? Have you lost hope? Let us walk together through these pages and find healing and comfort in the arms of a God who will never reject us. God will not abandon you. He is not like the people who have failed you. He never throws up his hands and walks away. He never quits loving. I would not compare my father with God, but on that February day in our driveway, my dad offered me exactly what God offers us. God stands with his arms wide open, waiting to renew us in his embrace. When we come to him broken, with our fears multiplied and more questions than answers, God wraps his arms around us and says, &#39;Welcome home.&#39; Do you know someone who is broken? Do you want to help? Perhaps you recognize that living among you right now are people hiding deep wounds. You may be sitting unaware in church week after week with suffering people, even as friends and acquaintances sat beside me while I smiled and behaved as though I didn&#39;t have a care in the world. If your desire is to help, then let us explore ways to create safe places in which our wounded neighbors, friends, and loved ones can express themselves. Like my father, you might become the welcoming arms of God to the broken person in your pew. Let us hope so--- let us pray it may be so. For this is what we were made to be: God&#39;s arms of love, both as individuals and as the church. Scripture says, &#39;Bear one another&#39;s burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ&#39; (Galatians 6:2).</p><h2>The Wake of the Lorelei Lee: Being an Account of the Further Adventures of Jacky Faber, on Her Way to Botany Bay (Bloody Jack Adventures)</h2><p>Jacky Faber, rich from her exploits diving for Spanish gold, has purchased the Lorelei Lee to carry passengers across the Atlantic.

Although haiku originated as a Japanese art form, it has found a welcome home in the English-speaking world. This collection tells the story for the first time of Anglophone haiku, charting its evolution over the last one hundred years and placing it within its historical and literary context. It features an engaging introduction by former U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins and an insightful historical overview by leading haiku poet, editor, and publisher Jim Kacian. <p>The selections range from the first fully realized haiku in English, Ezra Pound&#x2019;s &#x201c;In a Station of the Metro,&#x201d; to plentiful examples by haiku virtuosos such as John Wills, Marlene Mountain, Nick Virgilio, and Raymond Roseliep, and to investigations into the genre by eminent poets like John Ashbery, Allen Ginsberg, and Seamus Heaney. The editors explore the genre&#x2019;s changing forms and themes, highlighting its vitality and its breadth of poetic styles and content. Among the many poems on offer are organic form experiments by E. E. Cummings and Michael McClure, evocations of black culture by Richard Wright and Sonia Sanchez, and the seminal efforts of Jack Kerouac.</p><p>The first anthology to map the full range of haiku in the English tradition, <em>Haiku in English</em> is the perfect collection of this spare and elegant genre.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jim Kacian</strong> is the founder of the Haiku Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to archiving and promoting haiku in English, and of Red Moon Press, the largest non-Japanese publisher of haiku-related books.

In his enlivening and informative introduction, poet Billy Collins avers that what is essential to haiku is not the precise number of syllables&#x2014;traditionally 17 syllables are arranged 5-7-5&#x2014;but rather the &#x201c;epiphanic jolt, the &#x2018;A ha!&#x2019; moment.&#x201d; And, indeed, many poets dispense with syllable count and line configuration altogether. Collins notes, too, that the &#x201c;tiny genre&#x201d; was popularized &#x201c;just in time for the Beats to adopt it and give it a special American twist.&#x201d; Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Snyder do appear here, along with Langston Hughes, Wallace Stevens, Sonia Sanchez, and many poets who will be new to readers. Kacian concludes with an invaluable overview of the evolution of an enduring form that is freshly enticing and breathtaking in this time of small screens and pop-up messages.

Magestic Mountains describes Le Bon's experiences climbing 30 of the most famous mountains on six continents, illustrated by 175 photos. Besides considerable technical information, the work includes a climbing history of each peak, an equipment list, and travel tips, making it useful for serious mountaineers as well as armchair enthusiasts. Both groups will enjoy Le Bon's firsthand accounts of his adventures. Rowell's 101 magical photos complement the Sierra Club's edition of Muir's 1912 classic The Yosemite , which celebrates the 100th anniversary of this national park. The combined artistry and shared passion of Muir and of Rowell, well known for his 1986 Sierra Club work, Mountain Light , make this a stunning tribute to one of America's favorite national parks. As expected, the works abound in breathtaking full-color photograhs of dramatic landscapes, mountains, and animals. These are quality books sure to garner an enthusiastic reception from today's increasingly conservation-minded public.

There are the spirits and ghosts around the world who&#x2019;ve been kind enough to show up and tell me their stories for the last half a century or so. There are the 2,014 visitors to my Web site who had the courage and generosity to e-mail their experiences to me, some of which you&#x2019;ll find in the pages that follow&#x2014;and let me make it clear right now, I read every single one of those e-mails. Those 2,014 brave people were on the receiving end of some fascinating appearances by spirits and ghosts, some of them deeply comforting and some of them terrifying. There&#x2019;s a victim of an unsolved murder who told me the name of her killer, and there&#x2019;s a Spirit Guide who left her voice on an audiotape, repeating a single word that gave a woman the key to her husband&#x2019;s criminal life. There&#x2019;s a woman who was given strength by a visit with an ex-boyfriend on The Other Side who she didn&#x2019;t know had passed away, and a man who would never have found out he had a stillborn baby sister if her spirit hadn&#x2019;t come to introduce herself when he was four years old.<p> To the thousands of us collaborators on this particular book, and the many millions who don&#x2019;t question any more than we do that of course there&#x2019;s an afterlife, there are those who will always be ready with a list of handy explanations for what we &#x201c;think&#x201d; we&#x2019;re seeing, hearing, and feeling. &#x201c;Grief hysteria,&#x201d; &#x201c;oxygen deprivation,&#x201d; and variations on terms for both &#x201c;mental illness&#x201d; and &#x201c;scam&#x201d; are among the most popular. What these skeptics and &#x201c;experts&#x201d; are usually insisting on, though, is the same cynical demand, over and over and over again, which boils down to: </p><p> &#x201c;Prove that there&#x2019;s life after death.&#x201d; </p><p> I&#x2019;m sixty-six years old, and I&#x2019;ve never spent one instant doubting that there&#x2019;s life after death. The thousands of us who contributed to this book, on earth and beyond it, don&#x2019;t doubt it. The millions we represent don&#x2019;t doubt it. God certainly doesn&#x2019;t doubt it, since He&#x2019;s the One who told us it&#x2019;s true in the first place, and we take His word for everything. We&#x2019;re not the ones who are having a problem with this. You are. So why do we keep knocking ourselves out trying to prove something we already know with absolute certainty? </p><p> Here&#x2019;s my suggestion to the skeptics and &#x201c;experts,&#x201d; for a refreshing change of pace. We&#x2019;re done proving that there&#x2019;s life after death. We&#x2019;ve proven it well past our own satisfaction. From now on, let&#x2019;s do it this way: You prove that there&#x2019;s not. <br><br> <b>Chapter One</b><br><br> <b>THE TRUTH ABOUT GHOSTS AND SPIRITS</b><br><br> I believe in ghosts, and in the real and magnificent presence of spirits among us from The Other Side. </p><p> I believe because, like so many of you, I&#x2019;ve seen them, heard them, been startled by them, even smelled the faint familiar fragrance of a lost loved one, urging me to notice, to embrace their assurance that they&#x2019;re not gone at all, they&#x2019;re right here, not some trick of my imagination or wishful thinking, if I&#x2019;ll just open my eyes, ears, mind, and heart and pay attention. </p><p> I believe because, surrounded by so much overwhelming evidence of their existence during my sixty-six years on this earth, I&#x2019;d be insane not to believe. </p><p> Most of all, I believe because I know to the core of my being that the majority of the world&#x2019;s great religions are right&#x2014;we are all eternal, every one of us, as our birthright from God who created us. Our spirits always were and always will be. Our physical bodies are only temporary housing for the essence of who we are, that divine part of us that feels joy and sorrow and love and reverence and holds our truth and our timeless memories and our wisdom intact. Death will take our bodies sooner or later, but it can never, ever destroy us. God promised us everlasting lives, and He doesn&#x2019;t break His promises. </p><p> And it&#x2019;s precisely because I take God at His word that I can&#x2019;t imagine not believing in the existence of ghosts and spirits among us. If our spirits really do transcend death, if they&#x2019;re immortal as we know they are, that means they never cease to exist. So why on earth would we disbelieve the existence of something we agree never ceases to exist? In fact, why not recognize that the presence of ghosts, and of spirits from Home, is actually comforting, even worthy of celebration, proving as it does that eternal life is a beautiful, sacred, God-given certainty? </p><p> Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. I&#x2019;m not saying that the unexpected appearance of a ghost or a spirit can&#x2019;t be scary. You&#x2019;ll read stories throughout the book in which many of you have been frightened, and I&#x2019;ll openly admit to moments of fear during my own stories as well. Some combination of surprise, a cultural insistence that anyone who sees ghosts and spirits is either crazy or lying, and a lack of understanding of what&#x2019;s happening can add up to very real jolts of panic in even the most rational among us. </p><p> But please take my word for a few important truths about ghosts and spirits: </p><p> For one thing, knowledge really is power. The more I&#x2019;ve learned and the more I continue to learn about the spirit world, the more my fear has been replaced by curiosity and fascination, and you&#x2019;ll find the same is true for you; I guarantee it. </p><p> For another thing, as so many of you are already aware, it&#x2019;s not just us psychics and other &#x201c;weirdos&#x201d; who routinely have perfectly valid encounters with ghosts and spirits. &#x201c;Normal&#x201d; people in every corner of every country on earth have come face to face with visitors from the afterlife. These people know what they&#x2019;ve experienced, they know they&#x2019;re not crazy, they know the experience was real, and they don&#x2019;t need me or anyone else to validate it for them. And they&#x2019;d agree with me on this, I&#x2019;m sure. Just as any scientist would be a fool to get the same result from the same experiment over and over again and refuse to believe it, all of us who have seen, heard, and felt the presence of the spirit world would be just as foolish to refuse to believe what our five physical senses, our minds, and our hearts would swear to. </p><p> Finally, as momentarily frightened as I&#x2019;ve been by some of my encounters with residents of the afterlife, I can assure you, I&#x2019;ve never met a ghost or spirit who could do a fraction of the physical and emotional damage human beings can do. Give me a choice between a confrontation with the world&#x2019;s orneriest ghost or the world&#x2019;s most cunning human sociopath and I&#x2019;ll choose to take on the ghost every time. So while this journey into the spirit world we&#x2019;re about to take together will lead us into territory we might occasionally find scary and unnerving, don&#x2019;t spend one instant wondering whether or not you have enough courage to take the trip. You were brave enough to choose another lifetime as a human being on this rough, confusing, beautiful earth, which makes you brave enough to meet ghosts and spirits, especially since we&#x2019;ve all been those ghosts and spirits before and will be again when this lifetime ends.<br><br> THE SPIRIT&#x2019;S JOURNEY <br> AFTER DEATH<br><br> In order to understand what spirits and ghosts really are and where they come from, it&#x2019;s essential to understand what happens to our spirits when our physical bodies die. I&#x2019;ve written about this in great detail in previous books, particularly <i>Life on The Other Side</i>, so rather than repeat myself at length, I&#x2019;ll limit this discussion to a few relevant specifics.</p><p> When the spirit leaves the body that&#x2019;s provided it with temporary housing for another visit to earth, there are basically three different places it might go. And make no mistake about it, which of those three places the spirit travels to is our decision, not God&#x2019;s. He never stops loving us, never turns away from us, and would never condemn any of us to an eternity of banishment from His presence. It&#x2019;s only when we stop loving Him and turn away from Him that we take such foolish chances with the health and well-being of our souls. </p><p> The vast majority of us, who love God by whatever name we call Him and try our best to honor His love while we&#x2019;re here, immediately transcend to <i>The Other Side</i>, that sacred, exquisite, perfect world we came from, where we live joyfully among the Angels, the messiahs, our Spirit Guides, our soul mates and loved ones from an eternity of lifetimes both on earth and at Home. Residents of <i>The Other Side</i> are called spirits, and their appearances in our midst on earth are called visitations. </p><p> A much smaller percentage of humankind, those dark, remorseless souls who choose evil over God, travel to an unspeakable unholy void called the Left Door, from which they horseshoe right back into an earthly womb, to be reborn into another Godless incarnation. The Dark Side, as we call those travelers through the Left Door, don&#x2019;t communicate with us or appear among us while they&#x2019;re in vitro. </p><p> And then there are those poor trapped souls who, for their own often confused reasons, refuse to acknowledge the very real tunnel leading to The Other Side, illuminated by God&#x2019;s brilliant white light, and remain earthbound. Earthbound souls are called ghosts, and their appearances in our midst are called hauntings. </p><p> Understanding the differences between spirits and ghosts, between visitations and hauntings, can help turn an unexpected encounter with the afterlife from frightening to comforting. It can help us tell an earthbound intruder from a beloved visitor from Home. It can answer questions about where a departed loved one went after leaving their body, how they are, and whether or not they&#x2019;re happy. And it can certainly give us fascinating glimpses into the possibilities that lie ahead for us when our current incarnations are complete. </p><p> But before I go into any further detail about the brilliant, complex spirit world we&#x2019;re about to explore, I want to address an issue that came up in several of the hundreds upon hundreds of letters my clients and readers were kind enough to send. Antonio, for example, wrote, in the midst of a description of coming face to face with a ghost in his hou...</p></p><h2>Book of the Dead</h2><p>Relocating to Charleston after a particularly grueling case, Dr. Kay Scarpetta opens a private forensic pathology practice but is quickly targeted by local politics and a covert saboteur before a series of violent deaths bring her skills into high view. 1,500,000 first printing.

On the other side of old, wavy glass is the piazza, and the fountain, and the night.</p><p>She sits quietly in water, and the water is very cold, with melting ice cubes in it, and there is little in her eyes&#x2014;nothing much there anymore. At first, her eyes were like hands reaching out to him, begging him to save her. Now her eyes are the bruised blue of dusk. Whatever was in them has almost left. Soon she will sleep.</p><p>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; he says, handing her a tumbler that was handblown in Murano and now is filled with vodka.</p><p>He is fascinated by parts of her that have never seen the sun. They are pale like limestone, and he turns the spigot almost off, and the water is a trickle now, and he watches her rapid breathing and hears the chattering of her teeth. Her white breasts float beneath the surface of the water, delicate like white flowers. Her nipples, hard from the cold, are tight pink buds. Then he thinks of pencils. Of chewing off nubby pink erasers when he was in school, and telling his father and sometimes his mother that he didn&#x2019;t need erasers because he didn&#x2019;t make mistakes. When in truth, he liked to chew. He couldn&#x2019;t help it, and that also was the truth.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll remember my name,&#x201d; he says to her.</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I can forget it.&#x201d; Chattering.</p><p>He knows why she says it: If she forgets his name, her destiny will be rethought like a bad battle plan.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asks. &#x201c;Tell me my name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d; Crying, shaking.</p><p>&#x201c;Say it,&#x201d; he says, looking at her tan arms, pebbly with goose bumps, the blond hair on them erect, her young breasts and the darkness between her legs underwater.</p><p>&#x201c;Will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the rest of it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rambo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you think that&#x2019;s amusing,&#x201d; he says, naked, sitting on the lid of the toilet.</p><p>She shakes her head vigorously.</p><p>Lying. She made fun of him when he told her his name. She laughed and said Rambo is make-believe, a movie name. He said it&#x2019;s Swedish. She said he isn&#x2019;t Swedish. He said the name is Swedish. Where did she think it came from? It&#x2019;s a real name. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Like Rocky,&#x201d; she said, laughing. &#x201c;Look it up on the Internet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a real name,&#x201d; he said, and he didn&#x2019;t like that he had to explain his name. This was two days ago, and he didn&#x2019;t hold it against her, but he was aware of it. He forgave her because despite what the world says, she suffers unbearably.</p><p>&#x201c;Knowing my name will be an echo,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It makes no difference, not in the least. Just a sound already said.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would never say it.&#x201d; Panic.</p><p>Her lips and nails are blue, and she shivers uncontrollably. She stares. He tells her to drink more, and she doesn&#x2019;t dare refuse him. The slightest act of insubordination, and she knows what happens. Even one small scream, and she knows what happens. He sits calmly on the lid of the toilet, his legs splayed so she can see his excitement, and fear it. She doesn&#x2019;t beg anymore or tell him to have his way with her, if that&#x2019;s the reason she&#x2019;s his hostage. She doesn&#x2019;t say this anymore because she knows what happens when she insults him and implies that if he had a way it would be with her. Meaning she wouldn&#x2019;t give it willingly and want it.</p><p>&#x201c;You realize I asked you nicely,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Teeth chattering.</p><p>&#x201c;You do know. I asked you to thank me. That&#x2019;s all I asked, and I was nice to you. I asked you nicely, then you had to do this,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You had to make me do this. You see&#x201d;&#x2014;he gets up and watches his nakedness in the mirror over the smooth marble sink&#x2014;&#x201c;your suffering makes me do this,&#x201d; his nakedness in the mirror says. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t want to do this. So you&#x2019;ve hurt me. Do you understand you&#x2019;ve critically hurt me by making me do this?&#x201d; his nakedness in the mirror says.</p><p>She says she understands, and her eyes scatter like flying shards of glass as he opens the toolbox, and her scattered gaze fixes on the box cutters and knives and fine-tooth saws. He lifts out a small bag of sand and sets it on the edge of the sink. He pulls out ampules of lavender glue and sets them down, too.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do anything you want. Give you anything you want.&#x201d; She has said this repeatedly.</p><p>He has ordered her not to say it again. But she just did.</p><p>His hands dip into the water, and the coldness of the water bites him, and he grabs her ankles and lifts her up. He holds her up by her cold, tan legs with their cold, white feet and feels her terror in her panicking muscles as he holds her cold ankles tight. He holds her a little longer than last time, and she struggles and flails and thrashes violently, cold water splashing loudly. He lets go. She gasps and coughs and makes strangling cries. She doesn&#x2019;t complain. She&#x2019;s learned not to complain&#x2014;it took a while, but she&#x2019;s learned it. She&#x2019;s learned all of this is for her own good and is grateful for a sacrifice that will change his life&#x2014;not hers, but his&#x2014;in a way that isn&#x2019;t good. Wasn&#x2019;t good. Can never be good. She should be grateful for his gift.</p><p>He picks up the trash bag he filled with ice from the ice maker in the bar and pours the last of it in the tub and she looks at him, tears running down her face. Grief. The dark edges of it showing.</p><p>&#x201c;We used to hang them from the ceiling over there,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Kick them in the sides of their knees, over and over. Over there. All of us coming into the small room and kicking the sides of their knees. It&#x2019;s excruciatingly painful and, of course, crippling, and, of course, some of them died. That&#x2019;s nothing compared to other things I saw over there. I didn&#x2019;t work in that prison, you see. But I didn&#x2019;t need to, because there was plenty of that type of behavior to go around. What people don&#x2019;t understand is it wasn&#x2019;t stupid to film any of it. To photograph it. It was inevitable. You have to. If you don&#x2019;t, it&#x2019;s as if it never happened. So people take pictures. They show them to others. It only takes one. One person to see it. Then the whole world does.&#x201d;</p><p>She glances at the camera on the marble-top table against the stucco wall.</p><p>&#x201c;They deserved it anyway, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;They forced us to be something we weren&#x2019;t, so whose fault was it? Not ours.&#x201d;</p><p>She nods. She shivers, and her teeth chatter.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t always participate,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I did watch. At first it was difficult, perhaps traumatic. I was against it, but the things they did to us. And because of what they did, we were forced to do things back, so it was their fault that they forced us, and I know you see that.&#x201d;</p><p>She nods and cries and shakes.</p><p>&#x201c;The roadside bombs. Kidnapping. Much more than you hear about,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You get used to it. Just like you&#x2019;re getting used to the cold water, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>She isn&#x2019;t used to it, only numb and on her way to hypothermia. By now her head pounds and her heart feels as if it will explode. He hands her the vodka, and she drinks.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to open the window,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;So you can hear Bernini&#x2019;s fountain. I&#x2019;ve heard it much of my life. The night&#x2019;s perfect. You should see the stars.&#x201d; He opens the window and looks at the night, the stars, the fountain of four rivers, and the piazza. Empty at this hour. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t scream,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>She shakes her head and her chest heaves and she shivers uncontrollably.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking about your friends. I know that. Certainly they&#x2019;re thinking about you. That&#x2019;s too bad. And they aren&#x2019;t here. They aren&#x2019;t anywhere to be seen.&#x201d; He looks at the deserted piazza again and shrugs. &#x201c;Why would they be here now? They&#x2019;ve left. Long ago.&#x201d;</p><p>Her nose runs and tears spill and she shakes. The energy in her eyes&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not what it was when he met her, and he resents her for ruining who she was to him. Earlier, much earlier, he spoke Italian to her because it changed him into the stranger he needed to be. Now he speaks English because it no longer makes a difference. She glances at his excitement. Her glances at his excitement bounce against it like a moth against a lamp. He feels her there. She fears what&#x2019;s there. But not as much as she fears everything else&#x2014;the water, the tools, the sand, the glue. She doesn&#x2019;t comprehend the thick black belt coiled on the very old tile floor, and she should fear it most of all.</p><p>He picks it up and tells her it&#x2019;s a primitive urge to beat people who can&#x2019;t defend themselves. Why? She doesn&#x2019;t answer. Why? She stares at him in terror, and the light in her eyes is dull but crazed, like a mirror shattering right in front of him. He tells her to stand, and she does, shakily, her knees almost collapsing. She stands in the frigid water and he turns off the spout. Her body reminds him of a bow with a taut string because she&#x2019;s flexible and powerful. Water trickles down her skin as she stands before him.</p><p>&#x201c;Turn away from me,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m not going to beat you with the belt. I don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>Water quietly laps in the tub as she turns away from him, facing old, cracked stucco and a closed shutter.</p><p>&#x201c;Now I need you to kneel in the water,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;And look at the wall. Don&#x2019;t look at me.&#x201d;</p><p>She kneels, facing the wall, and he picks up the belt and slides the end of it through the buckle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten days later. April 27, 2007. A Friday afternoon.</p><p>Inside the virtual-reality theater are twelve of Italy&#x2019;s most powerful law enforcers and politicians, whose names, in the main, forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta can&#x2019;t keep straight. The only non-Italians are herself and forensic psychologist Benton Wesley, both consultants for International Investigative Response (IIR), a special branch of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI). The Italian government is in a very delicate position.</p><p>Nine days ago, American tennis star Drew Martin was murdered while on vacation, her nude, mutilated body found near Piazza Navona, in the heart of Rome&#x2019;s historic district. The case is an international sensation, details about the sixteen-year-old&#x2019;s life and death replayed nonstop on television, the crawls at the bottom of the screen doing just that&#x2014;crawling by slowly and tenaciously, repeating the same details the anchors and experts are saying.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Dr. Scarpetta, let&#x2019;s clarify, because there seems to be much confusion. According to you, she was dead by two or three o&#x2019;clock that afternoon,&#x201d; says Captain Ottorino Poma, a medico legale in the Arma dei Carabinieri, the military police heading the investigation.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not according to me,&#x201d; she says, her patience beginning to fray. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s according to you.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowns in the low lighting. &#x201c;I was so sure it was you, just minutes ago, talking about her stomach contents and alcohol level. And the fact they indicate she was dead within hours of when she was seen last by her friends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say she was dead by two or three o&#x2019;clock. I believe it is you who continues to say that, Captain Poma.&#x201d;</p><p>At a young age he already has a widespread reputation, and not an entirely good one. When Scarpetta first met him two years ago in the Hague at the ENFSI&#x2019;s annual meeting, he was derisively dubbed the Designer Doctor and described as extraordinarily conceited and argumentative. He is handsome&#x2014;magnificent, really&#x2014;with a taste for beautiful women and dazzling clothes, and today he is wearing a uniform of midnight blue with broad red stripes and bright silver embellishments, and polished black leather boots. When he swept into the theater this morning, he was wearing a red-lined cape.</p><p>He sits directly in front of Scarpetta, front row center, and rarely takes his eyes off her. On his right is Benton Wesley, who is silent most of the time. Everyone is masked by stereoscopic glasses that are synchronized with the Crime Scene Analysis System, a brilliant innovation that has made the Polizia Scientifica Italiana&#x2019;s Unit� per l&#x2019;Analisi del Crimine Violento the envy of law enforcement agencies worldwide.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose we need to go through this again so you completely understand my position,&#x201d; Scarpetta says to Captain Poma, who now rests his chin on his hand as if he is having an intimate conversation with her over a glass of wine. &#x201c;Had she been killed at two or three o&#x2019;clock that afternoon, then when her body was found at approximately eight-thirty the following morning, she would have been dead at least seventeen hours. Her livor mortis, rigor mortis, and algor mortis are inconsistent with that.&#x201d;</p><p>She uses a laser pointer to direct attention to the three-dimensional muddy construction site projected on the wall-size screen. It&#x2019;s as if they are standing in the middle of the scene, staring at Drew Martin&#x2019;s mauled, dead body and the litter and earthmoving equipment around it. The red dot of the laser moves along the left shoulder, the left buttock, the left leg and its bare foot. The right buttock is gone, as is a portion of her right thigh, as if she had been attacked by a shark.</p></p><h2>A Taste of Aloha: A Collection of Recipes from the Junior League of Honolulu</h2><p>COLLECTION OF RECIPES FROM THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF HONOLULU.</p><p></p><h2>Return of the Jedi (Star Wars, Episode VI)</h2><p>It was a dark time for the Rebel Alliance...<br>Han Solo, frozen in carbonite, had been delivered into the hands of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.

Not only are they the supreme plant for shade, but they also can be used in the landscape either as striking specimen plantings or as accommodating companion plants. Few pests bother them, and little maintenance is required, making hostas even more attractive to busy gardeners.</p><p>Each year a staggering number of new hostas are introduced. To assist gardeners and landscapers in selecting the right hosta for a particular situation, veteran plantswoman Diana Grenfell has teamed up with distinguished photographer Mike Shadrack in selecting 280 of the best hostas. Ranging from tried and true favorites to cutting edge newcomers bursting with potential, each plant has been handpicked for its superb performance in the landscape. An additional 545 hostas are briefly mentioned.</p></p><p>Diana Grenfell is co-founder of the British Hosta and Hemerocallis Society and a life member of the American Hosta Society. With her husband, Roger Grounds, she is former co-owner of Apple Court, a British nursery specializing in hostas, daylilies, and grasses. Diana has done much to raise the profile of hostas throughout the world, broadcasting, lecturing, and writing many authoritative books and articles on the plant. Her garden in Gloucestershire is home to a National Plant Collection of miniature hostas."One of the most important reference books a gardener can own."<i></i> (<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)<br><br>"This compact book...describes 280 old and new cultivars, with ample advice for selecting and caring for them."<i></i> (<i>Washington Gardener</i>)<br><br> <p>"I would certainly recommend this book for those, like me, who have been severely bitten by the hosta bug."</p></p><h2>Why the Sky Is Far Away: A Nigerian Folktale</h2><p>A cautionary African tale explains how people&#39;s greed and disrespect for the earth and sky has made harvesting food more difficult than it used to be.</p><p>Mary-Joan Gerson has written five books for children. She was inspired to write this story after spending time in Nigeria with the Peace Corps. Mary travels extensively to explore different cultures and discover new ways to see the world, and enjoys sharing that experience with children and adults through her books.<br><br>Carla Golembe is an award-winning illustrator, artist, author, and teacher. Her artwork, in a wide range of mediums including acrylic on paper and canvas, gouache, and monotype, has been featured at galleries across the country. <br>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- This pourquoi tale, first told 500 years ago by the Bini tribe of Nigeria, has a topical message that is accessible to children without being heavy-handed. ``In the beginning,'' the sky was so close to the earth that anyone who was hungry could just reach up, take a piece, and eat it. The sky was delicious, tasting sometimes of meat stew, sometimes of roasted corn. But the people grew careless with the sky's gifts, taking more than they needed to satisfy their hunger. The sky grew angry, threatening to withhold its gifts if the people continued to waste them. True to its promise, the sky moved far away, and the Bini were forced to plow the fields and hunt the forest. Golembe's striking illustrations deepen and enrich this simple tale, adding immensely to the book's appeal. Using a strong, sure line and a palette of deep, vibrant colors, she evokes a timeless African landscape, resonating both the mythic and contemporary themes. The symbolic qualities of the story are strengthened by a deceptively simple composition and the weight of the flat, stylized figures, done in dense, pure black. An eye-catching choice for folklore or picture book collections, and especially useful in supplementing multicultural and ecological curricula. --Linda Boyles, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Renaissance Christmas</h2><p>Uses text from the King James Bible, selections of Renaissance poetry and carols, and Renaissance artwork from the National Gallery to retell the Christmas story.</p><p></p><h2>You Can Knit That: Foolproof Instructions for Fabulous Sweaters</h2><p>When knitting superstar Amy Herzog gets complimented on her hand-knit sweaters, the compliments are often followed by &#x201c;but I could never knit that.&#x201d; Now, you can! <i>You Can Knit That</i> is a clear, simple reference book and pattern collection that gives knitters the sweater-making confidence they need.

Extreme weather is breeding banditry, humanitarian crisis, and state failure. <p>In <i>Tropic of Chaos</i>, investigative journalist Christian Parenti travels along the front lines of this gathering catastrophe--the belt of economically and politically battered postcolonial nations and war zones girding the planet's midlatitudes. Here he finds failed states amid climatic disasters. But he also reveals the unsettling presence of Western military forces and explains how they see an opportunity in the crisis to prepare for open-ended global counterinsurgency. </p><p>Parenti argues that this incipient "climate fascism"--a political hardening of wealthy states-- is bound to fail. The struggling states of the developing world cannot be allowed to collapse, as they will take other nations down as well. Instead, we must work to meet the challenge of climate-driven violence with a very different set of sustainable economic and development policies.</p></p><p><b>Christian Parenti</b> is a contributing editor at the <i>Nation</i>.

Reprint.</p><p><p><b>Zane Grey </b>(1872-1939), born in Ohio, was practicing dentistry in New York when he and his wife published his first novel. Grey presented the West as a moral battleground in which his characters are destroyed because of their inability to change or are redeemed through a final confrontation with their past. The man whose name is synonymous with Westerns made his first trip west in 1907 at age thirty-five. More than 130 films have been based on his work.</p>Gough's distinctive and thoroughly Western voice sets the stage for Grey's fascinating sequel to RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE. These are timeless, articulate stories of the old, untamed Southwest and the Native Americans, Mormons, and Easterners who populated it. As tenderfoot John Shefford wanders through Durango, Tuba City, and Kayenta, Gough lovingly reads Grey's prosaic descriptions of the beauty of the high desert and Navajo culture. His perfectly cadenced reading and accents lend a true storyteller's dimension to this romantic tale.

Legally registered to carry 376 people, the boat was packed with 2,100 recently released Union prisoners of war. More than 1,700 people died, making it the worst marine disaster in U.S. history.<br>To focus on the personal stories of the victims, both civilian and soldier, Gene Eric Salecker patiently collected material from hundreds of letters, period newspaper stories, and other sources. Readers are first introduced to the individuals involved while they are languishing in Confederate prisons and follow their release to an exchange camp outside Vicksburg and their eventual crowding onto the Sultana.<br>The author's knowledgeable narrative is interwoven with personal reminiscences, including those of the heroic rescuers. He offers unprecedented details about the captain's handling of the steamboat and corrects some long-held myths about the placement of the soldiers on the Sultana and newspaper coverage of the disaster.<br>A large portion of the book covers rescue attempts, both successful and failed, and the aftermath of the disaster as it affected those involved. With its emphasis on the human-interest aspect of the Sultana's loss, this book brings to the literature a critical point of view and much new research.</p><p>The worst maritime disaster in American history has received little historical attention, even though more people died from the 1865 <i>Sultana</i> explosion than drowned when the <i>Titanic</i> sank in 1912. Gene Eric Salecker painfully reconstructs the events leading up to the tragedy, when more than 2,000 federal troops crowded onto a side-wheel steamboat built to carry fewer than 300 people. Most of them were former prisoners of war, paroled after the Confederate surrender and finally heading home after years of struggle. We will never know why three of the <i>Sultana</i>'s big boilers blew up and claimed 1,700 lives, although Salecker runs through several possible causes. <i>Disaster on the Mississippi</i> is an authoritative account of a forgotten chapter of American history.</p><h2>In a Strange Room</h2><p>SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2010 MAN BOOKER PRIZE SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2010 ROYAL SOCIETY OF LITERATURE ONDAATJE PRIZE A young man takes three journeys, through Greece, India and Africa.

A South African man travels in Greece, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, and India, forming the complicated, tenuous relationships that provide the book&#39;s three sections titles (Follower; Lover; Guardian). This character, who bears the author&#39;s name and seems to share his history, is both &#34;he&#34; and &#34;I.&#34; Though these shifts can occur in the space of a sentence, they&#39;re surprisingly easy to accept, and attentive readers will get a subtle, frank depiction of some of the problems of writing; &#34;he&#34; seems to be Galgut, but often experiences himself as divided, uncertain, and blurry as a fictional character evading his creator, &#34;I&#34; often steps in to remind us of the limits of memory and the artificiality of genre distinctions. At its best Galgut&#39;s tale has the feel of arriving in a destination you&#39;d never planned to go. It&#39;s not always pleasant, but it&#39;s strangely fascinating.</p><h2>Homesick For Another World</h2><p><b>'Razor-sharp&#x2019; Zadie Smith </b><br><br><b>An electrifying, prizewinning short story collection from the Booker-shortlisted author of <i>Eileen</i> and<i> My Year of Rest and Relaxation.</i></b><br><br>There&#x2019;s something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh&#x2019;s stories, something almost dangerous while also being delightful &#x2013; and often even weirdly hilarious.

When former Navy and Marine servicewoman Johnson (Making Waves, 1986) took over the pseudonymous ``Parkmont High'' classroom of a teacher who'd had a breakdown, she found herself surrounded by unruly, unmotivated students partial to Atom Bomb cologne and thunderbolt hair styles. At first, they tried the usual tricks, and Johnson, like others before her, nearly despaired (``I shook my head, and bit my lower lip, trying not to cry''). But she persisted, using an original mix of boot-camp tactics and genuine warmth, and, one by one, the students responded--like Danny, ``an advanced thinker caught in the body of a remedial student,'' who, inspired by Johnson's parakeet, turned from marginal to remarkable; or Curtis, who'd had a blank journal all year until The Merchant of Venice seized his imagination (``I never had anything to say before''). Along the way, Johnson learns a few lessons of her own, from simple management skills (``outshouting kids is like trying to teach a pig to sing'') to, most reluctantly, the hard facts of life (``You can't save a kid who doesn't want to be saved''). We've been up this down staircase before, especially in the late 1960's when an armful of books (by Kozol, Kohl, Herndon) first dramatized great inequities in school systems and the sad shuffle awaiting those least able to speak up for themselves. Johnson shows the importance of basic respect, constant encouragement, and unorthodox teaching strategies for a generation (another generation) of disenfranchised students. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>While her Marine Corps training helped, Johnson found the caring parts of her personality more effective in dealing with the recalcitrant students she met as a teacher of English at "Parkmont High," an inner-city school in California. There, she has struggled to reach and teach a group of teenagers, many from immigrant families, who often revel in nonachievment and accept their roles as failures. Colorful anecdotes detail the successes and setbacks of an inspirational teacher with a crusty sense of humor who has resorted to "a little blatant bribery" and devised unorthodox approaches (one elaborate scheme involving kissing a kid who slept in class) to accommodate minority students' learning styles and improve their self-images. Humor tempers Johnson's gritty portrayal of her battle to keep her students from slipping through bureaucratic cracks. Her book radiates unsentimental affection for these kids, who "keep me coming back every year to my lopsided wooden desk, my crumbling bulletin boards, my outdated textbooks, and my own handful of dreams." <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The World&#39;s Great Chess Games</h2><p>Noted chess author annotates great contests beginning with 16th-century master Ruy Lopez.

He was both one of the world&#39;s strongest grandmasters of chess and one of the world&#39;s leading authorities on psychoanalysis. Reuben Fine was remarkable not merely for having two successful careers, but for achieving top levels and being world renowned in both fields. Fine took up chess in his youth, became a master as a teenager and at age 17 won his first of seven US Open Chess Championships. He was invited to the great masters tournament in Pasadena 1932, won by World Champion Alekhine, one of the strongest tournaments ever held in the United States. Fine&#39;s victories in a series of European tournaments in 1936 and 1937 established Fine as a top contender for the World Chess Championship. This led to his greatest result ever, his tie for first in the strongest chess tournament ever played, AVRO 1938, a double round-robin tournament to determine who would be the next challenger to World Champion Alexander Alekhine. Fine tied with Paul Keres, won more games than anybody, and finished ahead of future champion Mikhail Botvinnik, current champion Alekhine, former world champions Max Euwe and Capablanca, and Grandmasters Samuel Reshevsky and Salo Flohr. Fine won both of his games against Alekhine. Reuben Fine died on March 26, 1993 in New York.</p><h2>Kingfish: The Reign of Huey P. Long</h2><p>From the moment he took office as governor in 1928 to the day an assassin&#x2019;s bullet cut him down in 1935, Huey Long wielded all but dictatorial control over the state of Louisiana. A man of shameless ambition and ruthless vindictiveness, Long orchestrated elections, hired and fired thousands at will, and deployed the state militia as his personal police force. And yet, paradoxically, as governor and later as senator, Long did more good for the state&#x2019;s poor and uneducated than any politician before or since. Outrageous demagogue or charismatic visionary? In this powerful new biography, Richard D. White, Jr., brings Huey Long to life in all his blazing, controversial glory. <br>White taps invaluable new source material to present a fresh, vivid portrait of both the man and the Depression era that catapulted him to fame. From his boyhood in dirt-poor Winn Parish, Long knew he was destined for power&#x2013;the problem was how to get it fast enough to satisfy his insatiable appetite. With cunning and crudity unheard of in Louisiana politics, Long crushed his opponents in the 1928 gubernatorial race, then immediately set about tightening his iron grip. The press attacked him viciously, the oil companies howled for his blood after he pushed through a controversial oil processing tax, but Long had the adulation of the people. In 1930, the Kingfish got himself elected senator, and then there was no stopping him.<br>White&#x2019;s account of Long&#x2019;s heyday unfolds with the mesmerizing intensity of a movie. Pegged by President Roosevelt as &#x201c;one of the two most dangerous men in the country,&#x201d; Long organized a radical movement to redistribute money through his Share Our Wealth Society&#x2013;and his gospel of pensions for all, a shorter workweek, and free college spread like wildfire. The Louisiana poor already worshiped him for building thousands of miles of roads and funding schools, hospitals, and universities; his outrageous antics on the Senate floor gained him a growing national base. By 1935, despite a barrage of corruption investigations, Huey Long announced that he was running for president.<br>In the end, Long was a tragic hero&#x2013;a power addict who squandered his genius and came close to destroying the very foundation of democratic rule. Kingfish is a balanced, lucid, and absolutely spellbinding portrait of the life and times of the most incendiary figure in the history of American politics.</p><p>Richard D. White, Jr., is a professor of public administration at Louisiana State University and the author of Roosevelt the Reformer: Theodore Roosevelt as Civil Service Commissioner 1889&#x2014;1895. He lives in Baton Rouge.CHAPTER 1<br><br> 1927<br><br> A WEDDED MAN WITH A STORM FOR A BRIDE<br><br> Huey Long climbed onto a large bale of fresh-picked cotton and gazed out at a crowd of farmers attending a country fair. For a few moments he stood motionless, his shoulders hunched like a boxer waiting for the first bell to ring. Leaning forward to talk to the men in the front row, Huey began speaking in a whispery voice so quiet that the crowd shuffled closer to hear him. After a couple of minutes, he slowly raised his voice, a little louder each minute, until he roared to the gathering throng. He threw off his coat, rolled up his shirtsleeves, and slackened the red silk tie hanging around his neck. His voice booming across the dusty fairgrounds, Huey pummeled his audience with old-fashioned soapbox oratory and hell-for-leather political bluster. He whooped and hollered, pounded his fist, and punched in the air at imaginary enemies. His face turned the color of a ripe tomato. Twirling his arms above his head in the sweltering Louisiana heat, perspiration pouring down his cheeks, he quickly captivated the audience with spellbinding charisma and homespun guile.<br><br> It was the summer of 1927 and Huey was running full speed for governor of Louisiana. At every stop on the campaign trail, he treated his listeners to a boiling mixture of snake-oil salesmanship, burlesque tap dancing, evangelicism, and blistering billingsgate. He would preach to the crowd, holding a Bible in his hand in holy uplift and quoting from memory lengthy passages of the Scriptures. From Galatians he taunted his adversaries. &#x201c;Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?&#x201d; More often though, Huey spewed a torrent of abuse upon his foes. He branded his political opponents with epithets like &#x201c;low-down vile and slanderous men,&#x201d; &#x201c;thieves, bugs, and lice,&#x201d; &#x201c;grafters and money boodlers,&#x201d; &#x201c;graveyard robbing politicians,&#x201d; and &#x201c;blackguards in full-dress suits.&#x201d; His audience, mostly rural folk who took their politics raw like corn whiskey, could not get enough. &#x201c;You tell &#x2019;em, Huey,&#x201d; the farmers yelled back. &#x201c;Go get &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br><br> Huey&#x2019;s crowd of farmers looked up at a man in his thirties, of medium height, approaching pudginess with a round face, puffy jowls, and skin glowing pink like a fresh sunburn. An unruly mop of chestnut-colored hair topped his head, with a curly forelock that tumbled down. An oversized nose jutted from his face and his brown eyes were large, round, and expressive, shifting from jest to rage in a twinkling. When he walked, he jostled along &#x201c;like a saddling pony.&#x201d; As Huey dazzled his audiences, at times he appeared almost childish, spoiled, and &#x201c;like an overgrown small boy with very bad habits indeed.&#x201d; In an instant, however, his face could turn exceedingly hard and cruel.<br><br> A dominating egotist, Huey hungered for the spotlight and could not bear to share it with another. &#x201c;The only kind of band in which Huey Long could play,&#x201d; one newspaper editor wrote, &#x201c;was a one-man band.&#x201d; A skillful speechmaker, he craved the microphone. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember back to a time when my mouth wasn&#x2019;t open whenever there was a chance to make a speech,&#x201d; he remarked. He could not stand to be ignored by the newspapers, admitting that &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what they say about me as long as they say something.&#x201d; He knew that Louisiana voters would cast their votes for a known thief before they would vote for a name they did not recognize. Desperately wanting to be noticed, he dressed in a dazzling mix of pastel suits, purple shirts, flaming red flowered ties, and two-toned wing tips that provoked one onlooker to describe him as an explosion in a paint factory. &#x201c;Drama was his natural art,&#x201d; a supporter wistfully remembered, &#x201c;an actor whose stage was his work, whose scenery, the people about him.&#x201d;<br><br> Perpetually in motion, Huey wielded his &#x201c;energy of ten men&#x201d; as one of his most effective weapons. If he could not whip his political opponents with his brilliance or cunning, he simply wore them out by working harder, traveling more miles, making more speeches, shaking more hands, and twisting more arms. &#x201c;He never relaxed,&#x201d; observed a campaign worker. &#x201c;He got along with little or no sleep when he was under pressure. He awakened associates at all hours of the night to talk over a new notion which had come to him in bed.&#x201d; Always mesmerizing, he cast a spell upon his listeners. While he spoke at the parish fair that summer, a man who hated him stood to the side of the crowd, then disappeared. Later, one of Huey&#x2019;s supporters saw the man and asked why he left. &#x201c;I left because I was afraid. That guy was convincing me. I had to get out.&#x201d;<br><br> huey long was born on August 30, 1893, in Winn Parish, Louisiana, amid the red-clay hill country dotted with longleaf pine and where a dark and relentless poverty sapped the lives of the straitlaced Baptists who struggled to survive there. The people there were so poor that, according to a wry local joke, they made a living by taking in each other&#x2019;s wash. Many of them lived in clapboard cabins with dirt floors and subsisted off small worn-out farms, cut-over timber lands, and paltry cotton patches. The parish seat, Winnfield, languished as a mud-pathed village of about two thousand residents, with two hotels, a lumber mill, seven other buildings, and neither running water nor electricity. The town was notable only for &#x201c;large numbers of hogs and children, and by a scarcity of Negroes.&#x201d;<br><br> A year before Huey was born, his parents, Hugh and Caledonia Long, moved from Tunica, Mississippi, to Winnfield. Hugh bought 320 acres of scrub land, which he cultivated with cotton and corn and where he let his hogs run wild in the woods. After 1900, Winnfield became a railroad hub, with four lines passing through the town, and the site of a roundhouse and repair shops. The railroad built a depot on the Long farm and within ten years the town grew to about three thousand inhabitants. Hugh sold part of the farm in lots. On one side of his farm the business section rose and on the other side residences sprang up. Although far from wealthy, Hugh became one of largest landowners and livestock holders in Winnfield. He grew and raised most of what the family consumed, and when they needed cash, he sold a pig or cow. In 1907, he built a large home in Winnfield, with two stories, ten rooms, electric lights, indoor plumbing, high ceilings, and large columned verandas on three sides. Two big white oaks sat in the front yard and celery and asparagus sprouted in a bed at one end of the front porch.<br><br> Hugh Long turned forty when Huey was born in 1893. By then, Hugh&#x2019;s hair was an iron gray and his face brown and wrinkled like a walnut shell. A gangly six-footer, he glared at people through the same penetrating brown eyes that all nine of his children would possess. Hugh loved to talk in a booming voice and could be found sitting in front of Bernstein&#x2019;s store in Winnfield under an ancient chinaberry tree, amusing the townsfolk with his dry wit. Hugh was eccentric, gentle, even weak, had only an elementary education, and bragged of voting for the Socialist candidate for president, Eugene Debs.<br><br> Huey&#x2019;s mother, Caledonia, like his father, came from Pennsylvania Dutch stock. A slender, hazel-eyed, and raven-haired woman who weighed less than a hundred pounds, Caledonia was disciplined, self-educated, and had a photographic memory that Huey would inherit. She insisted her children read the Bible and attend the First Baptist Church of Winnfield. She had a preacher baptize Huey in a neighbor&#x2019;s fishpond but the boy rebelled against his Baptist upbringing. Caledonia, who refused to whip her children, tried to manage Huey, the most unruly and headstrong of her nine offspring, but her efforts proved futile. Even before he could walk he demanded that he control everything and everyone around him. Always inquisitive, as a toddler he wandered off and on one occasion crawled beneath a steam locomotive and delayed a train departing the Winnfield station. As a rebellious teenager he smoked, drank, chewed tobacco, and cussed like a field hand.<br><br> Caledonia passed on her charitable spirit to Huey. Known throughout the parish as a generous and compassionate woman, she frequently sent her son to deliver food and clothing to less fortunate families. From his parents, Huey inherited a belief that the wealth of the land should be shared and that &#x201c;none should be too poor and none too rich.&#x201d; Caledonia insisted that Huey and the other children read avidly. If one of the youngsters was reading, the mother would not assign the child chores. The clever Huey learned to always have a book in his hands, whether or not he read it. At an early age he memorized long passages from the Bible, pored over Shakespeare&#x2019;s Julius Caesar, Hamlet, and The Merchant of Venice, and once bet a friend $10 that he could recite Bunyan&#x2019;s Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress. He admired Dumas&#x2019;s The Count of Monte Cristo, where the lead character metes out harsh revenge to his enemies. John Clark Ridpath&#x2019;s History of the World also made a lasting mark upon young Huey.

On May 25, 1841, the Massachusetts whaleship Sharon set out for the whaling ground of the northwestern Pacific. A year later, while most of the crew was out hunting, Captain Howes Norris was brutally murdered. When the men in the whaleboats returned, they found four crew members on board, three of whom were covered in blood, the other screaming from atop the mast. Single-handedly, the third officer launched a surprise attack to recapture the Sharon, killing two of the attackers and subduing the other. An American investigation into the murder was never conducted--even when the Sharon returned home three years later, with only four of the original twenty-nine crew on board.<br><br> Joan Druett, a historian who's been called a female Patrick O'Brian by the Wall Street Journal, dramatically re-creates the mystery of the ill-fated whaleship and reveals a voyage filled with savagery under the command of one of the most ruthless captains to sail the high seas.</p><p>Native New Zealander JOAN DRUETT is the author of eleven books on maritime history and historical fiction. She has been the recipient of a PEN/Hubert Church Award, a Fulbright Fellowship, and the John Lyman Award for Best Book of American Maritime History. She was a consultant for the award-winning &#34;Seafaring Women&#34; exhibition and has appeared as a guest speaker at maritime museums across the country. While much of her research is carried out in the United States, she lives in Wellington, New Zealand, with her husband, Ron.A small notice in a Sydney shipping publication in 1842 hinted of a bigger story: A Massachusetts-based whaling ship, the SHARON, was putting into port due to desertions and the murder of its captain. Parts of the story were publicized at the time, but other pieces remained secret for years. Joan Druett decided to take a closer look at events that may have inspired Herman Melville's TYPEE and MOBY-DICK. She investigated the journals and personal logs written at the time to find the characters and motives behind the unusual events. Dennis Boutsikaris goes beyond a dry, factual reading to create a gripping drama of cruelty on the seas, as suspenseful as any of Melville's fiction.

William Domhoff.</p><p></p><h2>Thomas Jefferson</h2><p>In her sixth presidential biography for National Geographic, Cheryl Harness illuminates the many sides of Thomas Jefferson: scientist, lawyer, farmer, architect, diplomat, inventor, musician, philosopher, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of the University of Virginia, and third president of the United States. Readers meet this extraordinary man of contradictions: a genius who proclaimed that "All men are created equal" and championed the rights of "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness," while at the same time living a life that depended on the enforced labor of slaves. <br><br>Readers experience an eventful life lived largely in public service, yet also enjoy the personal warmth of this fascinating historical figure. The narrative examines the crucial role that the "sage of Monticello" played in shaping the ideals of freedom and self-government, which became the cornerstones of American democracy. The author's conversational storytelling, her richly detailed illustrations, and use of period maps bring to life the exciting times of Thomas Jefferson on every page. This appealing and insightful biography is an honest, well-balanced portrait of a complex and controversial American legend.<br><br>National Geographic supports K-12 educators with ELA Common Core Resources.<br>Visit&nbsp;www.natgeoed.org/commoncore&nbsp;for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Cheryl Harness</b> is the author and/or illustrator of more than 30 children&#x2019;s books, including several picture book biographies for National Geographic.

Harness has won multiple awards, and now lives in her historic hometown of Independence, Missouri. To learn more, visit cherylharness.com.Gr. 4-7. Harness continues her successful series of picture books about the presidents with Jefferson, who is more controversial than some of her previous subjects. Harness brings up his relationship with slave Sally Hemings in her introduction, but, curiously, almost drops the subject in the text. A somewhat larger problem is Harness' attempt to fit a huge amount of material into a relatively small space. Situations are truncated, and at times, readers will have to make informational leaps. That said, this is still a remarkable book; it gives children a sense of Jefferson's personality, his exceptional skills, and even the demons he struggled with as he tried to reconcile his belief that all men are created equal and his role as a slaveholder. Harness uses every opportunity to squeeze in more information, and her striking watercolor, gouache, ink, and colored-pencil pictures and maps add extra detail. There are no notes, and the bibliography is brief, but there's a useful time line highlighting Jefferson's world. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Wayside School was supposed to be built with 30 classrooms all next to each other in a row. Instead, the classrooms were stacked one on top of the other--30 stories tall! Here are some hilarious and fun stories from Wayside School.</p><p>The Wayside School was supposed to be one story high, with 30 classrooms side by side; instead, it was built sideways, with 30 one-classroom stories. As befits such a strange school, these tales are a bit strange too. In one, Jason is stuck to his seat by a large wad of chewing gum. His teacher tries throwing ice water on him (to chill the gum to brittleness) and turning him upside down. She even contemplates cutting his pants off. Finally, though, he falls from his upside-down position when kissed (ugh!) by one of the girls in the class. Other tales include a bit of a moral, such as the story of Kathy, whose assumption that no one will ever like her is proved right, or the story of Bebe, who draws quickly but without artistic merit. The quirky humor in this book is appealing to children, and it makes a good read-aloud book for the younger set.

The act was intended both as retribution for the massacre of workers in the Homestead strike and as an incitement to revolution.

[We] watch Berkman become humanized, tolerant, able to sympathize with the most diverse and antagonistic individuals.... No other book discusses so frankly the criminal ways of the closed prison society, its homosexuality or extortion. No other political prisoner even remotely approaches Berkman's sympathy for what most of the revolutionaries refer to contemptuously as common criminals. -- <i>Kenneth Rexroth</i><br><br>[Berkman's] prison memoirs are fantastic....

When Shams disappeared, Rumi began his transformation from scholar to artist, and his poetry began to take wing.

In under two minutes, the Mayor had us up on horseback, Morpeth and Angharrad coming running from round the back of the ruins of the cathedral, and by the time we'd hopped up, stepping over the still unconshus bodies of the men who tried to help me overthrow the Mayor, there was the army taking messy shape in front of us.<br><br>Not all of it, tho, maybe less than half, the rest still stretched up along the southern road to the hill with the notch on it, the road to where the battle was sposed to be.<br><br>Angharrad's thinking and I can feel spikes of nerves all thru her body.

"Are you?"<br><br>"Just get on with it."<br><br>And his smile gets even wider. He turns to the men. "Two divisions down the western road for the first attack!" His voice snakes thru everyone's head again, like a sound you can't ignore. "Captain Hammar's division at the front, Captain Morgan taking the rear! Captains Tate and O'Hare will round up the rest of the men and armaments yet to arrive and join the fray with the greatest dispatch."<br><br>Armaments? I think.<br><br>"If the fight isn't already over by the time they join us-" The men laugh at this, a loud, nervous, aggressive kind of laugh.<br><br>"Then as a united army, we will drive the Spackle back up that hill and make them regret the day they were EVER BORN!"<br><br>And the men give a roaring cheer.<br><br>"Sir!"

I baked the cake, iced the cake, and served it up. It looked like a cake, but as soon as you cut into it and took a taste, you knew something else was going on. People are like that, too. Sometimes you just can&#x2019;t tell what&#x2019;s on the inside from looking at the outside. Sometimes people are a big surprise, just like the salt cake.

And sometimes the surprise is just friggin&#x2019; confusing. <br>Joe Morelli is one of those good surprises. He&#x2019;s two years older than I am, and for most of my school years, spending time with Morelli was like a visit to the dark side, alluring and frightening. He&#x2019;s a Trenton cop now, and he&#x2019;s my off-again, on-again boyfriend. He used to be the hair-raising part of my life, but my life has had a lot of changes, and now he&#x2019;s the normal part. He has a dog named Bob, and a nice little house, and a toaster. On the outside Morelli is still street tough and dangerously alluring. On the inside Morelli is now the sexy guy with the toaster. Go figure. <br>I have a hamster named Rex, a utilitarian apartment, and my toaster is broken. My name is Stephanie Plum, and I work as a bond enforcement agent, also known as a bounty hunter, for my cousin Vinnie. It&#x2019;s not a great job, but it has its moments, and if I mooch food off my parents the job almost pays enough to get me through the month. It would pay a lot more but the truth is, I&#x2019;m not all that good at it. <br>Sometimes I moonlight for a guy named Ranger who&#x2019;s extremely bad in an incredibly good way. He&#x2019;s a security expert, and a bounty hunter, and he moves like smoke. Ranger is milk chocolate on the outside... a delicious, tempting, forbidden pleasure. And no one knows what&#x2019;s on the inside. Ranger keeps his own counsel. <br>I work with two women I like a lot. Connie Rosolli is Vinnie&#x2019;s office manager and junkyard dog. She&#x2019;s a little older than I am. A little smarter. A little tougher. A little more Italian. She&#x2019;s got a lot more chest, and she dresses like Betty Boop. <br>The other woman is my sometimes-partner Lula. Lula was at this moment parading around in the bail bonds office, showing Connie and me her new outfit. Lula is a way-beyond-voluptuous black woman who was currently squashed into four-inch spike heels and a sparkly gold spandex dress that had been constructed for a much smaller woman. The neckline was low, and the only thing keeping Lula&#x2019;s big boobs from popping out was the fact that the material was snagged on her nipples. The skirt was stretched tight across her ass and hung two inches below the full moon. <br>With Connie and Lula you get what you see. <br>Lula bent to take a look at the heel on her shoe, and Connie was treated to a view of the night sky. <br>&#x201c;Crikey,&#x201c; Connie said. &#x201c;You need to put some underwear on.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I got underwear on,&#x201c; Lula said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m wearing my best thong. Just &#x2018;cause I used to be a &#x2018;ho don&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m cheap. Problem is that little thong stringy gets lost in all my derriere.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tell me again what you&#x2019;re doing in this getup,&#x201c; Connie said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna be a rock-and-roll singer. I got a gig singing with Sally Sweet&#x2019;s new band. You heard of the Who? Well, we&#x2019;re gonna be the What.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t sing,&#x201c; Connie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard you sing. You can&#x2019;t hold a tune to &#x2018;Happy Birthday.&#x2019; &#x201c; <br>&#x201c;The hell I can&#x2019;t,&#x201c; Lula said. &#x201c;I could sing your ass off. Besides, half those rock stars can&#x2019;t sing. They just open their big oversize mouths and yell. And you gotta admit, I look good in this here dress. Nobody gonna be paying attention to my singing when I&#x2019;m wearing this dress.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s got a point,&#x201c; I said to Connie. <br>&#x201c;No argument,&#x201c; Connie said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m underrealized,&#x201c; Lula said. &#x201c;I gotta lot of untapped potential. Yesterday my horoscope said I gotta expand my horizons.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You expand any more in that dress, and you&#x2019;ll get yourself arrested,&#x201c; Connie said. <br>The bonds office is on Hamilton Avenue, a couple blocks from Saint Francis Hospital. Handy for bonding out guys who&#x2019;ve been shot. It&#x2019;s a small storefront office sandwiched between a beauty parlor and a used bookstore. There&#x2019;s an outer room with a scarred imitation leather couch, a couple folding chairs, Connie&#x2019;s desk and computer, and a bank of files. Vinnie&#x2019;s office is located in a room behind Connie&#x2019;s desk. <br>When I started working for Vinnie he used his office to talk to his bookie and set up nooners with barnyard animals, but Vinnie has recently discovered the Internet, and now Vinnie uses his office to surf porn sites and online casinos. Behind the bank of file cabinets is a storeroom filled with the nuts and bolts of the bail bonds business. Confiscated televisions, DVD players, iPods, computers, a velvet painting of Elvis, a set of cookware, blenders, kids&#x2019; bikes, engagement rings, a tricked-out Hog, a bunch of George Foreman grills, and God knows what else. Vinnie had some guns and ammo back there too. Plus a box of cuffs that he got on eBay. There&#x2019;s a small bathroom that Connie keeps spotless and a back door in case there&#x2019;s a need to sneak off. <br>&#x201c;I hate to be a party pooper,&#x201c; Connie said, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;re going to have to put the fashion show on hold because we have a problem.&#x201d; She slid a stack of folders across her desk at me. &#x201c;These are all unresolved skips. If we don&#x2019;t find some of these guys we&#x2019;re going belly-up.&#x201d; <br>Here&#x2019;s the way bail bonds works. If you&#x2019;re accused of a crime and you don&#x2019;t want to sit and rot in jail while you&#x2019;re waiting for your trial to come up, you can give the court a wad of money. The court takes the money and lets you walk, and you get the money back when you show up on your trial date. If you don&#x2019;t have that money stashed under your mattress, a bail bondsman can give the court the money on your behalf. He&#x2019;ll charge you a percentage of the money, maybe ten percent, and he&#x2019;ll keep that percentage whether you&#x2019;re proven guilty or not. If the accused shows up for court, the court gives the bail bondsman his money back. If the accused doesn&#x2019;t show up, the court keeps the money until the bondsman finds the accused and drags his sorry butt back to jail. <br>So you see the problem, right? Too much money going out and not enough money going in, and Vinnie might have to refinance his house. Or worse, the insurance company that backs Vinnie could yank the plug. <br>&#x201c;Lula and I can&#x2019;t keep up with the skips,&#x201c; I said to Connie. &#x201c;There are too many of them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, and I&#x2019;ll tell you the problem,&#x201c; Lula said. &#x201c;It used to be Ranger worked full time for you, but anymore he&#x2019;s got his own security business going, and he&#x2019;s not doing skip tracing. It&#x2019;s just Stephanie and me catching the bad guys these days.&#x201d; <br>It was true. Ranger had moved most of his business toward the security side and only went into tracking mode when something came in that was over my head. There are some who might argue everything is over my head, but for practical purposes we&#x2019;ve had to ignore that argument. <br>&#x201c;I hate to say this,&#x201c; I told Connie, &#x201c;but you need to hire another bond enforcement person.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that easy,&#x201c; Connie said. &#x201c;Remember when we had Joyce Barnhardt working here? That was a disaster. She screwed up all her busts doing her big bad bounty hunter routine. And then she stole everyone&#x2019;s skips. It&#x2019;s not like she&#x2019;s a team player.&#x201d; <br>Joyce Barnhardt is my archenemy. I went all through school with her, and she was a misery. And before the ink was dry on my marriage license she was in bed with my husband, who is now my ex-husband. Thank you, Joyce. <br>&#x201c;We could put a ad in the paper,&#x201c; Lula said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how I got my filing job here. Look at how good that turned out.&#x201d; <br>Connie and I did eye rolls. <br>Lula was about the worst file clerk ever. Lula kept her job because no one else would tolerate Vinnie. The first time Vinnie made a grab at Lula she clocked him on the side of the head with a five-pound phone book and told him she&#x2019;d staple his nuts to the wall if he didn&#x2019;t show respect. And that was the end of sexual harassment in the bail bonds office. <br>Connie read the names off the files on her desk. &#x201c;Lonnie Johnson, Kevin Gallager, Leon James, Dooby Biagi, Caroline Scarzolli, Melvin Pickle, Charles Chin, Bernard Brown, Mary Lee Truk, Luis Queen, John Santos. These are all current. You already have half of them. The rest came in last night. Plus we have nine outstanding that we&#x2019;ve relegated to the temporarily lost cause file. Vinnie&#x2019;s writing a lot of bond these days. Probably taking risks he shouldn&#x2019;t. The result is more than the normal FTAs.&#x201d; <br>When someone doesn&#x2019;t show up for a court appearance we call them FTA. Failure to Appear. People fail to appear for a bunch of reasons. Hookers and pushers can make more money on the street than they can in jail so they only show up in court when you finally stop bonding them out. All other people just don&#x2019;t want to go to jail. <br>Connie gave me the new files, and it was like an elephant was sitting on my chest. Lonnie Johnson was wanted for armed robbery. Leon James was suspected of arson and attempted murder. Kevin Gallager was wanted for grand theft auto. Mary Lee Truk had inserted a carving knife into her husband&#x2019;s left buttock during a domestic disturbance. And Melvin Pickle w...</p></p><h2>The Wars of Reconstruction: The Brief, Violent History of America&#39;s Most Progressive Era</h2><p><p>By 1870, just five years after Confederate surrender and thirteen years after the Dred Scott decision ruled blacks ineligible for citizenship, Congressional action had ended slavery and given the vote to black men. That same year, Hiram Revels and Joseph Hayne Rainey became the first African-American U.S. senator and congressman respectively. In South Carolina, only twenty years after the death of arch-secessionist John C. Calhoun, a black man, Jasper J. Wright, took a seat on the state's Supreme Court. Not even the most optimistic abolitionists had thought such milestones would occur in their lifetimes. The brief years of Reconstruction marked the United States' most progressive moment prior to the civil rights movement. </p><p> Previous histories of Reconstruction have focused on Washington politics. But in this sweeping, prodigiously researched narrative, Douglas Egerton brings a much bigger, even more dramatic story into view, exploring state and local politics and tracing the struggles of some fifteen hundred African-American officeholders, in both the North and South, who fought entrenched white resistance. Tragically, their movement was met by ruthless violence-not just riotous mobs, but also targeted assassination. With stark evidence, Egerton shows that Reconstruction, often cast as a &#x201c;failure&#x201d; or a doomed experiment, was rolled back by murderous force.<i> The Wars of Reconstruction</i> is a major and provocative contribution to American history.</p></p><p><b>Douglas R. Egerton</b> is a professor of history at LeMoyne College. He is the author of six books, including <i>Year of Meteors: Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, and the Election that Brought on the Civil War, He Shall Go Out Free: The Lives of Denmark Vesey, Gabriel's Rebellion: The Virginia Slave Conspiracies of 1800 and 1802, </i>and <i>Death or Liberty: African Americans and Revolutionary America. </i>He lives near Syracuse, New York.<p>&#x201c;The history of [the] era [of Reconstruction] has rarely if ever been as well told as it is in Douglas R. Egerton's forcefully argued and crisply written <i>The Wars of Reconstruction</i>. Mr. Egerton presents a sometimes inspiring but more often deeply shocking story that reveals the nation at its best and worst...Mr. Egerton's prose...is readable and compelling...He moves his narrative forward with a fine eye for the drama of events, offering a chorus of contemporary voices along the way: those of ex-slaves, war veterans, do-gooders, opportunists, educators, churchmen and politicians of every stripe, among them defenders of racial privilege. He includes as well ex-Confederates such as the politically courageous James Longstreet, Robert E. Lee's senior corps commander, who after the war became a Republican and embraced biracial reform, and Northern black crusaders such as Octavius Catto of Philadelphia, who helped make the assertion of civil rights a national cause. Collectively these figures, speaking to us amid Mr. Egerton's always acute presentation of the intricacies of federal and state politics, bring to life the war that was taking place not just in the halls of government but also deep in the small towns, red-dirt hamlets and cotton fields, where the bloodiest combat of Reconstruction took place.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Wars of Reconstruction is one of the best and most readable studies of that era to appear in many years. Its emphasis on the active role that African Americans played in this crucial period is especially welcome. Douglas Egerton has given us another gripping, thoughtful, and deeply researched book about slavery and the fight for freedom.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bruce Levin, author of The Fallof the House of Dixie: The Civil War and the Social Revolution that Transformed the South</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a very "Du Boisian" work, sharing the great scholar's view that Reconstruction wasn't just about rebuilding the Southern economy, but reconstructing democracy throughout the US. Recounting Northern blacks' struggles for voting rights and the national quest for universal public education bolsters Du Bois's insight, as do sections assessing Reconstruction in scholarly and popular memory. Through detailed evaluations of officeholders and other activists, Egerton asserts that Reconstruction was the most progressive era in US history. Proponents of the 1960s and, especially, the New Deal may differ, but Egerton's strong case stimulates debate. Summing Up: Recommended.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>CHOICE</i></p><p>&#x201c;Key figures develop into rich characters, balancing Egerton's own objective, wide-seeing perspective, which even explores the revisionist Reconstruction histories that informed the American consciousness, particularly the pernicious effects of influential racist cinema. All told, Egerton's study is an adept exploration of a past era of monumental relevance to the present and is recommended for any student of political conflict, social upheaval, and the perennial struggle against oppression.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;A richly detailed history...An illuminating view of an era whose reform spirit would live on in the1960scivil rights movement.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>My Crowd</h2><p>From Back Cover: &#34;Long before ghoulish jokes and sick&#39; humor came into vogue, Charles Addams&#39; macabre cartoons had established his reputation as one of the deans of American comic art.

His unique approaches to the mysteries of justice and truth are full of the ordinary and the extraordinary, humor and humanism.</p><p>Karel Capek (1890-1938), one of the greatest Czechoslovakian authors of the century, and who mastered numerous forms of writing, was particularly inventive with the genre of mystery, detective, and crime fiction. In <i>Tales from Two Pockets,</i> however, Capek took the crime story and related forms of the genre to new levels, weaving strange, short, and powerful psychological studies of ordinary human beings caught in extraordinary and improbable circumstances. Through these intense but always fun stories, Capek moves brilliantly but lightly in the philosophical realms of human existence, exploring the nature of crime and justice, even the very concept of truth.<b>Karel Capek</b> (1890&#x2013;1938) is generally considered the greatest Czech author of the first half of this century. He was Czechoslovakia's leading novelist, playwright, story writer, and columnist, and the spirit of its short-lived democracy. His plays appeared on Broadway soon after their debut in Prague, and his books were translated into many languages. Capek expressed himself in the form of accessible and highly enjoyable writing.<br></p><h2>The Well-tempered Garden: New and Revised Edition</h2><p>An introduction to gardening which includes practical information on plant life and suggestions for planning a garden</p><p>Christopher Lloyd&#39;s love of and pride in gardening is evident in every word of this often-republished gardening classic. It&#39;s not an encyclopedic text, as much of it is specifically applicable to Lloyd&#39;s damp English climate, but as he says in his new introduction, &#34;We should always keep an open mind.&#34; Gardeners in many climates will do well with the plants Lloyd loves, and everyone can follow his advice on the basics of growing and propagating healthy plants."The Well-Tempered Garden is for gardeners who have not been dragged into this pursuit but are here because they love it." So writes Christopher Lloyd in the Introduction to this superb book. Here the beginning gardener will learn the basic skills of planting, pruning, weeding, staking, and deadheading. More advanced gardening enthusiasts are guided through ways to propagate plants, to select and care for different kinds of plants - perennials, shrubs, climbers, bulbs - and are also offered ideas about the many different kinds of gardens one might keep. He offers advice on roses, vegetables, fruits, ornamental plants, wild gardening in grass, and more.A strong-minded instructor, Lloyd knows that errors are inevitable, and rather than scolding encourages learning through experience. He opens our eyes to the beauty of the unexpected surprises that happen in the garden, whether on the part of the "fallible plant" or the "fallible gardener." All this from the man Henry Mitchell called "possibly the best garden writer alive."

Morgaine (more commonly known as Morgan Le Fay) and Gwenhwyfar (a Welsh spelling of Guinevere) struggle for power, using Arthur as a way to score points and promote their respective worldviews. <i>The Mists of Avalon</i>'s Camelot politics and intrigue take place at a time when Christianity is taking over the island-nation of Britain; Christianity vs. Faery, and God vs. Goddess are dominant themes. <p>Young and old alike will enjoy this magical Arthurian reinvention by science fiction and fantasy veteran Marion Zimmer Bradley. <i>--Bonnie Bouman</i></p>I love this book. Plain and simple: It's the absolute best retelling of the Arthurian legend I've ever read. Over the years, I've given copies to everyone close to me. I haven't reread it in years, but I must still talk about it, because when I was in Ireland and my husband commented to my 8-year-old daughter (who hasn't read it...yet!) that there are no snakes in Ireland, she piped up that the snakes that were supposedly driven out of Ireland by Saint Patrick were actually the Druid priests, whose wrists were encircled with snake tattoos. And that it's just a natural phenomenon that there are no native Irish snakes. And thus begins another generation of Mists of Avalon believers!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editor</p><h2>Confucius to Cummings: Poetry Anthology (New Directions Paperbook)</h2><p>This anthology is Ezra Pound&#x2019;s own choice of the poetry of various ages and cultures&#x2015;ranging from his translations of the Confucian Odes up to E. E. Cummings&#x2015;which he considered the finest of its type. It is a statement by example of the "Pound critical canon" and, as such, a short course in the history of world poetry, useful alike for the student and the general reader. Nearly a hundred poets are represented, a number of them in Pound&#x2019;s own translations, with emphasis on the Greek and Latin, Chinese, Troubadour, Renaissance, and Elizabethan. Of particular interest are the notes on certain of the poems and poets which Pound supplied in comment on his selections.</p><p>New Directions has been the primary publisher of Ezra Pound in the U.S. since the founding of the press when James Laughlin published New Directions in Prose and Poetry 1936. That year Pound was fifty-one. In Laughlin&#x2019;s first letter to Pound, he wrote: &#x201c;Expect, please, no fireworks. I am bourgeois-born (Pittsburgh); have never missed a meal. . . . But full of &#x2018;noble caring&#x2019; for something as inconceivable as the future of decent letters in the US.&#x201d; Little did Pound know that into the twenty-first century the fireworks would keep exploding as readers continue to find his books relevant and meaningful.</p><h2>The Country Diary Christmas Book</h2><p>This is a book of practical ideas for gifts, decorations and Christmas fare at the same time as being a portrait of an Edwardian Christmas. Ideas on how to gild walnuts for the tree, concoct a seasonal pot-pourri, or make traditional brandy butter to accompany the pudding are interspersed with Edith Holden's words and pictures and those of many other writers and artists of the times, such as Beatrix Potter, Robert Louis Stevenson and Virginia Woolf. They are accompanied by turn-of-the-century ideas for after-dinner games from the "Girls Own Companion", a description of Londoners tobogganing at midnight by the light of the moon from the "Illustrated London News", and "The Times" review of the first performance of J.M.

Stunning illustrations will leave readers breathless and deeply moved. Never heavy-handed, Mama Says teaches the universal importance of kindness, sharing, diligence, and faith, along with the importance of courage and a willingness to always try your best. Here is the perfect gift book for any mother--as a baby gift, a holiday gift, a birthday gift, a Mother's Day gift, or just as a way to say "I love you."</p><p>Rob D.

In addition to two Caldecott Medals (for Ashanti to Zulu and Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People&#x2019;s Ears), they have received four New York Times Best Illustrated Awards, four Boston Globe/Horn Book Awards, two Coretta Scott King Awards, and the Society of Illustrators Gold Medal, and were inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 1997.<br>Kindergarten-Grade 4&#x2014;Twelve different cultures are represented in this visually stunning, slightly oversize offering. For each one, a short poem stating wisdom or advice that a mother might offer a son is presented on the verso, along with a painting in a circular frame. The effect of the frame is to give readers the feeling that they are peeking in at a private moment between parent and child. The recto has a full-page illustration of the son acting on the advice. The poems are simple and direct and address everything from being honest to sharing and appreciating nature. Some have distinctly religious messages: "Mama says/Have faith/Mama says/Believe/Mama says/To trust in God/And let God take the lead." All of the poems are also presented in the language of the culture addressed, including Cherokee, Hindi, and Danish. The afterword details the specific sources used to obtain accurate translations. The artwork is nothing short of brilliant. Elegantly composed pictures not only capture and enhance the meaning of the poem they accompany, but also depict the various cultures with remarkable attention to detail. This is a lovely and important addition for most collections.&#x2014;<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Time Traders</i>, Ross Murdock has the choice of rehabilitation or volunteering for a secret research project, which turns out to be searching the past for the source of illicit technological innovations. In <i>Galactic </i>Derelict, Travis Fox stumbles on a time-travel project and has to be recruited for it; then he and his comrades take an involuntary trip aboard an alien starship that crashed on Earth before recorded history.

One tiny snail longs to see the world and hitches a lift on the tail of a whale. Together they go on an amazing journey, past icebergs and volcanoes, sharks and penguins, and the little snail feels so small in the vastness of the world. But when disaster strikes and the whale is beached in a bay, it&#39;s the tiny snail who saves the day. The Snail and the Whale is a delightful tale of adventure and friendship by the award-winning team behind The Gruffalo, Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler.</p><p>Julia Donaldson is the outrageously talented, prize-winning author of the world&#39;s best-loved picture books, and was the 2011-2013 UK Children&#39;s Laureate. Her books include Room on the Broom, What the Ladybird Heard and the modern classic The Gruffalo, which has sold over 13.5 million copies worldwide and has been translated into over sixty languages. Julia also writes fiction as well as poems, plays and songs and her brilliant live children&#39;s shows are always in demand. Julia and her husband Malcolm divide their time between Sussex and Edinburgh. Axel Scheffler is a star illustrator whose instantly recognisable, warm and witty illustrations have achieved worldwide acclaim and numerous awards. In addition to his picture books, Axel is the illustrator of wonderful novelty and gift books for Macmillan, such as the bestselling The Bedtime Bear, The Tickle Book and Mother Goose&#39;s Nursery Rhymes. He also illustrates the popular Pip and Posy series. Born in Hamburg, Axel now lives with his family in London.PreSchool-Grade 3--A tiny mollusk that longs to see the world hitches a ride aboard a humpback whale in this charming picture book. After seeing far-off islands, underwater caves, and storm-filled skies, the snail feels impossibly small--until the whale is beached in a harbor, and she saves the day by writing a note on the blackboard of a nearby school to summon help. The message that even the smallest among us can help others will not be lost on children, and neither will the poetic language: "A humpback whale, immensely long,/Who sang to the snail a wonderful song/Of shimmering ice and coral caves/And shooting stars and enormous waves." Donaldson's smooth, sprightly rhyming scheme buoys the story and never falters. The flat, cartoonish look of Scheffler's multimedia illustrations perfectly complements the tone of the text. The rollicking language and bright pictures make this a great choice for reading aloud.--Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Pepper</h2><p>Telling the song-by-song story of one of the greatest albums in rock history, the producer who shaped the Beatles&#39; sound shows how each song developed and provides intimate portraits of the Beatles at their peak. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>There are many (probably too many) books on the Beatles already, but this one is by someone closer professionally to the group than anyone else--George Martin, producer of all the Beatles' albums. With Pearson's help, Martin focuses on the making of <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, the landmark 1967 album that--with its exotic instruments, innovative recording techniques, and sophisticated songwriting--opened new possibilities for rock music and also captured its era's zeitgeist like few works of any kind before or since. Amid a detailed, song-by-song account of the recording of "the virtuoso music collage that is <i>Pepper</i>," Martin recalls his first meeting with the Beatles at their 1962 audition, discusses the band's musical influences, traces its members' rapid progress from makers of simple pop songs to composers of intricate art music, and confirms or denies many established bits of Beatles lore. Until one of the surviving band members pens his own autobiography, this is as intimate and accurate a look at the Beatles phenomenon as fans are going to get. <i>Gordon Flagg</i>In 1962 George Martin reluctantly signed a young group called the Beatles to the EMI record label. Thus began his stint as record producer for one of the most groundbreaking bands in pop history. Martin, writing with freelancer Pearson, describes in detail the creative processes-both artistic and technical-that went into making one of the most acclaimed Beatles albums, the 1967 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, "a musical fragmentation grenade, exploding with a force that is still being felt." Tracing each song on the record from its genesis in the mind of one of the Fab Four, Martin explains how each fragment or idea evolved, with input from the entire band and from the engineering team, into a final track, and how the album broke new ground. Fans hoping for an inside scoop on some of the more sensational aspects of the bandmembers' lives will be disappointed, but admirers of the Beatles' music and those who take an interest in the technical aspects of record production will find this book engrossing.

With Dustfinger dead, and the evil Adderhead now in control, the story in which they are all caught has taken an unhappy turn. Even Elinor,left alone in the real world, believes her family to be lost-lostbetween the covers of a book. As winter turns to spring, there isreason to hope- but only if Meggie and her father, and their loyal band of followers, are ready to make a dangerous deal with death.</p><p>A monumental third installment brings the Inkheart trilogy to a grueling, blood-spattered, mortality-obsessed close. The Inkworld is in disarray: Its author, Fenoglio, has lost his ability to write and, therefore, shape events; the odious Orpheus, however, has taken to recycling Fenoglio's words to control the narrative/world himself. The evil Adderhead, whose immortality was bound into the White Book by bookbinder-turned-people's champion Mo/the Bluejay, finds his body decomposing and demands a new Book; can Mo use the opportunity to end the villain's life altogether? Can Dustfinger come back from the dead? Will Resa's baby be born into peace or violence? Is Meggie falling out of love with Farid? (Thank goodness there's an A to Z of Names and Places!) Where the first volume was thoroughly young Meggie's story, this narrative alternates among a dizzying array of characters, most of whom are adults who betray distinctly adult concerns. While Funke's storytelling is as compelling as ever, the natural audience for this brooding saga seems, sadly, to be teens and up and not the children who so eagerly responded to Inkheart.

And will equip you to avoid the extremes surrounding the subject of the Holy Spirit and arm you with solid biblical teaching. Pastor Chuck believers that the Holy Spirit does work in the lives of Christians today and he offers a sane, scriptural approach that will encourage all believers to look to the Holy Spirit for guidance.</p><p>In the words of Chuck Smith, Charisma is a beautiful, natural anointing of God&#39;s Spirit upon a persons life, enabling him or her to do the work of God. Charismania is a fleshly endeavor to imitate charisma. It is any human effort to do the work of the Spirit in the energy or ability of the flesh. These displays of charismania take on many forms and always draw attention to the person rather than to Jesus Christ.In 1965, Pastor Chuck Smith began his ministry at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa. Only twenty-five people attended. What began as a small chapel has now grown into a church that seats over 2000 and is filled almost nightly.

At the center of this maelstrom of pyschobabble and unrequited lust sits Tom, program coordinator for the Young Women of Strength, who has been known to sob uncontrollably at meetings. When Tom tries to initiate a food fight, a rival psychologist bear hugs him into submission, resulting in an out-of-body experience that leaves our Tom hovering over his colleagues. In the hands of Donald Antrim, this unique perspective becomes an exuberantly funny riff on our culture that does nothing less than expose the core of emotions underlying the most basic of human needs.</p><p>The narrator of Donald Antrim's <i>The Verificationist</i> is a middle-aged psychotherapist who meets a handful of colleagues at a pancake house one evening to engage in the seemingly innocuous activity of socializing while eating stacks of fried batter. What commences is a psychosexual deadpan comedy fraught with academic grandstanding, subtle flirting, and lots of good eatin'. Before long, Tom decides to start a food fight, but is restrained in a bear hug by Bernhardt, the father figure of the group. Our hero then proceeds to have an out-of-body experience in which he eavesdrops on his cohorts and ruminates on such things as the very essence of the pancake: <blockquote> We eat pancakes to escape loneliness, yet within moments we want nothing more than our freedom from ever having so much as thought about pancakes. Nothing can prevent us, after eating pancakes, from feeling the most awful regret. After eating pancakes, our great mission in life becomes the repudiation of the pancakes and everything served along with them, the bacon and the syrup and the sausage and coffee and jellies and jams. But these things are beneath mention, compared with the pancakes themselves. It is the pancake--<i>Pancakes! Pancakes!</i>--that we never learn to respect. </blockquote> Antrim's prose, at home somewhere between the psychologist's couch and a diner's Naugahyde booth, follows this tack for just shy of 200 pages, without chapter or page breaks. Readers familiar with the writer's earlier novels, <i>The Hundred Brothers</i> and <i>Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World</i>, will spot this as his preferred modus operandi. <p> Tom, likewise, follows in the tradition of Antrim's other narrators--a timid yet well-meaning intellectual training his considerable observational and confessional skills upon a tableau at once pathetically banal and rife with meaning. Antrim has a talent for creating characters who speak contemporary psychobabble that falls far short of explaining the absurdity of their dilemmas. Rebecca, the pulchritudinous teenage waitress, and Escobar, Tom's suave Mediterranean friend, not only play their hour upon stage with earnest precision but serve to accentuate Tom's essentially pitiful nature. While Antrim's cast this time out is considerably downsized (literally 100 brothers appeared in <i>The Hundred Brothers</i>), he remains a writer who delights in bouncing disparate characters off one another with hilarious, disastrous results. </p><p> In plumbing the pathologies of millennial manhood, <i>The Verificationist</i> is part Robert Bly men's retreat, part sex comedy, and part doctoral thesis. It is served up like a combo platter, best enjoyed in a single sitting, and undeniably tasty. <i>--Ryan Boudinot</i></p>"If you could actually yank the control box from one of Antrim's busily cerebral novels, God knows what you'd find in there. Bats, maybe. An audiocassette edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, recited by Monty Python. And probably the shrunken heads of Thomas Pynchon, Nicholson Baker, Edgar Allan Poe and Donald Barthelme, writers whose DNA seems to have bled into Antrim's own.... <b>The Verificationist</b> is a striding tour through one man's addled mind. It's a book that clatters and whirs like a Rube Goldberg device, spitting out, on every page, perfectly formed pellets of intellection, rude humor, grief and longing."<br>-- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><p>"A darkly comic tour-de-farce that's at once attenuated and hyperkinetic.... Antrim has provided a striking meditation on the nature of self-identity and a fierce affirmation of the power of imagination."<br> -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br></p><p>"A hilarious send-up of psychoanalysis and a deeply original meditation on the nature of identity."<br>-- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br></p><p>"Antrim is that rarest of birds, a virtuoso satirist. In <b>The Verificationist</b> he plays the banal against the grotesque, sets a fool's reductionist logic grinding like a tiny wheel against the ceiling of a pancake house, finally opens the exit to the void. Antrim's extraordinary imagination has invited comparison of his work with that of Italo Calvino, but Antrim has a sharper razor, a diamond eye drilling our culture and time. In Antrim's pinball machine the reader ricochets from intellectual pleasure to anxiety to nervous laughter." <br>-- Annie Proulx <br></p><p>"Donald Antrim is in top form with this high-spirited hallucination, whose characters, undeniably ourselves, carry on engagingly and shamelessly, in an off-the-wall, not to mention off-the-ceiling, environment that is also the world we know, and sometimes wish we didn't." <br>-- Thomas Pynchon <br></p><p>"The guy has nailed me with his deadpan. Not since the late Donald Barthelme have we had such a pitch-perfect surrealizing of domestic American life, and given the already surreal nature of that life, this is saying something.... Antrim's art is to render the uncanny as if it were the canny. The confessional matter-of-factness of Tom's voice plays beautifully against the preposterous scenario.... A high-altitude view of therapists, sure. One man's existential self-confrontation, okay. More interesting to contemplate, though, is the tension of improbability that Antrim creates ... how vivid he makes that arguably near-universal split between vulnerable inwardness and the utterly implausible momentum of the outer world."<br>-- Sven Birkerts, <i>Esquire</i> magazine <br></p><p>"He offers another slaphappy narrator on the verge of regression and total crack-up.... Antrim strikes the perfect balance between levity and gravity."<br>-- <i>Time-Out</i></p></p><h2>Black angus</h2><p>Used with some tearing of cover</p><p></p><h2>Sweet Herbs and Sundry Flowers: Medieval Gardens and the Gardens of the Cloisters</h2><p>The Bonnefont Cloister at The Cloisters museum in New York City is a lovely space overlooking the Hudson River just above the George Washington Bridge.

He lives in Cambridgeshire.<p>ONE</p> <p>LIBERTY, PROPERTY, AND NO STAMPS!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>George III of Great Britain Revenue Stamp, 1765</p> <p>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA began with a stamp. This one.</p> <p>There had been, of course, other American beginnings. Nobody knows exactly when the country&#x2019;s first human inhabitants crossed the frozen Bering Strait from Siberia, or how many waves of such immigration took place: Three is the currently accepted figure, and 15,000 B.C. an estimated date for the first arrival&#x2014;into a land of giant bears, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, most of which soon became extinct. We do know that around the year 1000, the Vikings crossed the Atlantic in 50-foot ships to trade for wood and furs. Their main ports of call were in Canada, but a Norse coin has been found in Maine.</p> <p>Christopher Columbus landed on October 12, 1492&#x2014;on an island he named San Salvador. He never actually set foot on mainland North America, but despite this, he became lauded as the &#x201c;discoverer&#x201d; of the continent, as a magnificent 1893 stamp issue, the nation&#x2019;s first commemorative set, attests. Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the continent was named in 1507, never visited mainland North America, either (and never even got to appear on a U.S. stamp).</p> <p>In 1620, the <i>Mayflower</i> battled its way across the Atlantic to Cape Cod, its captain, passengers, and crew determined to build a free, godly &#x201c;City on a Hill.&#x201d;</p> <p>By 1692, there were more than 10 million Native Americans, comprising around five hundred tribes. To European eyes, North/Central America was part of three empires. The empire of Spain consisted of Mexico, the Southwest, and Florida. France ruled Louisiana and along the Mississippi. Britain controlled modern Canada and the thirteen colonies along the Eastern Seaboard. There was virtually no communication among these empires, and not a great deal among the thirteen British colonies, which were essentially ports on the edge of a vast, unexplored landmass. The year 1692, by the way, is significant because it marked the setting up of British America&#x2019;s first formal postal system&#x2014;which soon collapsed, due to the difficulties of organizing regular transportation and exchanging payments between the colonies, which had their own monetary systems. (The fact that the man in charge of the new system, Thomas Neale, lived in England and had never crossed the Atlantic didn&#x2019;t help.) In 1711, another, more serious attempt at creating a &#x201c;national&#x201d; postal service was made. This one took root. Long-distance communication was beginning to improve, though it would still take a letter a month to get from the post office in Williamsburg, Virginia, to the one in Boston. There were also by this time more colonists to send letters. The population had surpassed 250,000 in 1700 and was growing fast. By 1750 it would be over 1 million, and by 1765, the date of the stamp that opens this chapter, nearly double that. The Spanish and French empires did not share this dramatic growth, nor did the Native Americans, who were beginning to suffer from deadly diseases&#x2014;smallpox, measles, influenza&#x2014;brought across the Atlantic by the colonists.</p> <p>Between 1756 and 1763, Britain and France fought a vast war, arguably the first truly global conflict. Like most wars, it had left the combatants hugely in debt. In 1765, Britain wanted its colonies&#x2014;which it considered itself to have &#x201c;saved&#x201d; from French domination&#x2014;to pay some of that debt. On March 22, King George III&#x2019;s Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which required that his American subjects pay a new tax. All printing was to be carried out on paper embossed with a stamp like the one above, for which the printer had to pay a charge. The rate varied. A license to sell alcohol was to cost �4, while an employment contract or the grant of probate on a will would be charged 10 shillings. Also taxed would be almanacs, playing cards, and newspapers (taxed double if they featured writing in a foreign language). The penny stamp at the opening of this chapter would have been required on every example of a one-page pamphlet.</p> <p>Previous taxation in the thirteen colonies had taken the indirect form of import tariffs, but the Stamp Act cut straight to the heart of daily colonial life: It was a tax on information and communication. The response was immediate. The governing body of Virginia, the House of Burgesses, met on May 29 in Williamsburg to discuss a set of &#x201c;Resolves,&#x201d; the third of which argued that only &#x201c;the taxation of the people by themselves, or by persons chosen by themselves to represent them&#x201d; was legal. At the forefront of the debate was a young lawyer named Patrick Henry. During his speech, he declared: &#x201c;Caesar had his Brutus; Charles the First his Cromwell; and George the Third&#x201d;&#x2014;at which point, he was interrupted by cries of &#x201c;Treason!&#x201d; Henry paused, reminding himself, perhaps, that he was speaking to get a motion passed, not to incite regicide, before continuing, &#x201c;May he profit by their example!&#x201d; The Resolve was passed.</p> <p>Protests took place in the colonies&#x2019; streets, too. Stamp commissioners had been appointed to oversee the new tax, which was to take effect on November 1, and these individuals became the targets of rioters. On the morning of August 14, Boston awoke to find an effigy of Andrew Oliver, the local commissioner, hanging from an elm tree by a main road. Attached was a couplet:</p> <p><i>A goodlier sight who e&#x2019;er did see?</i></p> <p><i>A Stamp-Man hanging on a tree!</i></p> <p>People gathered and mocked the effigy; in the afternoon, it was taken into the center of town in a procession, the crowd shouting a new slogan: &#x201c;Liberty, Property, and No Stamps!&#x201d; Their first port of call was the newly built Stamp Office, a small wooden building that proved easy to demolish. The procession then headed to Oliver&#x2019;s house, outside of which the effigy was beheaded. Oliver resigned the next day.</p> <p>Similar &#x201c;liberty trees&#x201d; sprang up around the colonies. If no suitable tree could be found, a &#x201c;liberty pole&#x201d; sufficed, often topped with a red flag or a red conical Phrygian cap, a traditional symbol of revolt. These, naturally, served as meeting points for disaffected citizens. Often such meetings turned to violence: A few weeks after the Oliver incident, a crowd in Newport, Rhode Island, attacked the house of a man who had unwisely written a pamphlet called <i>A Colonist&#x2019;s Defense of Taxation</i>. These meetings were initially spontaneous, but they were soon being orchestrated by the Sons of Liberty&#x2014;a group that became ever more &#x201c;national&#x201d; in its organization, at least partially thanks to the Stamp Act. Other, more constitutionally minded opponents of the tax met in October to petition London to repeal the act. The proceedings came to be known as the Stamp Act Congress, the first meeting of colonial representatives not officially sanctioned by the crown. It drafted a Declaration of Rights and Grievances, a precursor to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</p> <p>By the time the Stamp Act was due to come into effect, there were hardly any commissioners left to enforce it. (The last one struggled on until November 16 before resigning.) The act limped along, ignored whenever possible, until a vote to repeal it was passed in the British Parliament on February 21, 1766. The Revenue Stamp that introduces this chapter was no more. But the mood that it had created&#x2014;of rebellion, but also of unity between the previously disparate colonies&#x2014;lived on.</p> <p>In June 1767, Britain tried taxing its unruly American colonies again. It went back to the old idea of import tariffs, raising duties on glass, paper, and tea. However, America would no longer accept even these. Boycotts of British goods were organized. A vicious cycle of public protest and official overreaction developed, centered on Boston. In February 1770, a crowd surrounded the house of Ebenezer Richardson, a customs officer, and started throwing stones at it. Richardson responded by shooting at the crowd, and a ten-year-old boy, Christopher Seider, was killed. A fortnight later, an argument outside the Customs House between a Bostonian and a British officer about an unpaid bill turned into a full-scale confrontation between Redcoats and colonists, ending up with the former firing on the latter and killing five people.</p> <p>The British decided to back down again, in part at least. Most of the new duties were rescinded, but tea remained taxed, and an effective monopoly on its importation was given to the British East India Company, an attempt to bail out a corrupt conglomerate that had gotten into financial difficulty. Cue the famous Tea Party of 1773, when Sons of Liberty disguised as Mohawks boarded ships in Boston Harbor and threw 342 crates of tea into the water. In response the harbor was blockaded and Boston placed under martial law, with British soldiers billeted with local families. These measures, which became known as the Intolerable Acts, incensed Americans further: Even the previously moderate George Washington commented that &#x201c;the Crisis has arrived.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Continental Congress that convened in September of 1774 was divided between sending further petitions to the king and pushing for independence. In the end, a petition was sent&#x2014;but a response from London would take months (two Atlantic voyages, seven weeks out and even longer coming back, on top of however long it took the British to make up their minds), and many people weren&#x2019;t prepared to wait that long. Radicals urged the formation and training of armed local militias. Patrick Henry, unsurprisingly, was among these, calling out in another debate, &#x201c;Give me liberty, or give me death!&#x201d;</p> <p>On April 19, 1775, a group of British soldiers set out from Boston to Concord to search for hidden arms. Such sorties had become quite common: The army had been transforming into an occupying force since the reaction to the Stamp Act a decade earlier. Halfway there, on the green of the village of Lexington, they encountered the local militia, who had gathered, alerted by Paul Revere on his famous ride. Debate still rages about who fired the first shot&#x2014;there are all sorts of theories, ranging from an outside provocateur to Redcoats trying to stop a prisoner escaping. An exchange of gunfire followed.</p> <p>Lexington was more a skirmish than a battle. Eight militiamen were killed, and their compatriots quickly fled their numerically superior opposition and hastened to Concord, where a better defense could be mounted. Even there, the Americans were initially outnumbered. The British searched the town, finding armaments (though most had been spirited away) and damaging property. While they were doing this, the American force grew in size: The colonials&#x2019; strategy was to use small, mobile forces that could be quickly augmented by &#x201c;minutemen,&#x201d; local part-time volunteers. Battle was finally joined at Concord&#x2019;s North Bridge. The British were forced to retreat. After a final attempt at a face-saving arms search, they headed back to Boston, harried with ever-increasing violence, where they were then encircled. The city was under siege.</p> <p>And all because of a stamp&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Chris West</p></p><h2>Final Warning</h2><p>New copy unmarked.

He writes a column for the <i>London Spectator</i>, contributes frequently to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and is a contributing editor of the Manhattan Institute's <i>City Journal</i>. His other books include <i>Our Culture, What's Left of It</i>, <i>Mass Listeria,</i> and <i>So Little Done</i>. He lives in Birmingham, England.Filled with poignant stories of women and men trapped in destructive behaviors and environments, this volume puts forth a vision of the modern world and of intellectualized modernism as hell but offers few concrete or theoretical solutions. Dalrymple, a noted conservative columnist in London's the Spectator, collects pieces he wrote for the conservative City Journal, using his own work as a physician in British slums and prisons as fodder for an analysis of the underclass: "not poor... by the standards of human history" but trapped in "a special wretchedness" from which it cannot emerge. Most of his patients put their violence in the passive: the murderer who says "the knife went in" as though he had no control; the man who beat his girlfriend and then exclaimed, " `I totally regret everything that happen' [sic] as if... [it] were a typhoon in the East Indies." The fault, Dalrymple asserts, is not bad environments, but a pervasive liberal view and agenda that creates "passive, helpless victims," encourages the idea that the acceptance of "unconscious motivations for one's acts" obviates personal responsibility, and the "widespread acceptance of social determinism." Dalrymple makes many astute observations on British social attitudes about wealth, the tattooing of white youths and urban redevelopment, and his writing is graceful and often witty. But his main points get hammered home too quickly and too often. His critique of liberalism and the welfare state, while sometimes provocative, is spelled out in the introduction and repeated again and again. While Dalrymple is preaching to the converted, his vivid writing and often heartbreaking stories rise above his deeply felt but repetitive social analysis. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The World of Richard Stine</h2><p>A retrospective collection of art and writing by this well known, witty, irreverent and inspirational artist and bestselling author. The book covers a wide range of subjects: love, art, relationships, spirituality, work, debt, responsibility, freedom, isolation, desire, conflict, dreams and creativity. 150 full-color illustrations. Size D. (Art/Architecture)</p><p>RICHARD STINE is the author of several illustrated books. From his home on an island off the coast of Seattle, which he shares with his wife Margaret, they create and publish a line of greeting cards through their company, Pal Press.Popular greeting-card illustrator Stine (Off to Sea, not reviewed) showcases his seductive full-color drawings and pithy texts, which give the subject of metaphysical angst in the '90s a decidedly mass-market spin. Stine's graphically striking style represents an eclectic inventory of au courant illustration techniques: meticulous and mellifluous inked line, scratchy pencil line, scumbled painted backgrounds, pasty pastel surfaces, complex webs of crosshatching, digitized computer imagery, photocopied pictorial manipulations, collage, and photo montage. Augmenting this are hand-lettered and typeset texts, which run the gamut from simple caption to poetic truism to diaristic vignette. The cover illustration sets the book's tone. In it, a thin male figure--presumably Stine--teeters atop a spirelike mountain, reaching for a single white star against a wash of azure sky. Inside, in ``Face to Face With The Second Step,'' a black dog rests on the step of an oversize blue geometric staircase, its panting red tongue playfully activating the composition. In many inclusions, lone figures are placed in psychologically charged landscapes, facing floating hearts that seem to represent love, hope, and loss. Texts--such as ``Even Lies Are Part of The Truth''--accompany some of the art. Occasionally Stine speaks of his own life: ``I think the next phase...is going to be the poet phase.'' Like illustrators Saul Steinberg, Robert Osborn, and Ralph Steadman before him, Stine has freely borrowed from the conventions of contemporary art to bring a level of perceived seriousness to his work. The plates have the look of greeting cards designed for yet-unnamed existentialist holidays. Poetic, pained, at times downright sappy, Stine's visual candy goes for the consumer jugular. Casting himself as a sensitive hero, he comes across like ``Jonathan Livingston Illustrator.'' (Book-of- the-Month Club selection) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Board of Education and Black America&#39;s Struggle for Equality</h2><p><i>Simple Justice</i>&nbsp;is generally regarded as the classic account of the U.S. Supreme Court's epochal decision outlawing racial segregation and the centerpiece of African-Americans' ongoing crusade for equal justice under law.<br><br>The 1954 Supreme Court ruling in the case of&nbsp;Brown v. Board of Education&nbsp;brought centuries of legal segregation in this country to an end. It was and remains, beyond question, one of the truly significant events in American history, "probably the most important American government act of any kind since the Emancipation Proclamation," in the view of constitutional scholar Louis H. Pollak. The Brown decision climaxed along, torturous battle for black equality in education, making hard law out of vague principles and opening the way for the broad civil rights upheavals of the 1960s and beyond.<br><i></i><br><i>Simple Justice</i>&nbsp;is the story of that battle. Richard Kluger traces the background of the epochal decision,from its remote legal and cultural roots to the complex personalities of those who brought about its realization. The result is a landmark work of popular history, graceful and fascinatingly detailed, the panoramic account of a struggle for human dignity in process since the birth of the nation.<br><br>Here is the human drama, told in all its dimensions, of the many plaintiffs, men, women, and children,variously scared or defiant but always determined, who made the hard decision to proceed - bucking the white power structure in Topeka,Kansas; braving night riders in rural South Carolina; rallying fellow high school students in strictly segregated Prince Edward County,Virginia - and at a dozen other times and places showing their refusal to accept defeat.<br><br>Here, too, is the extraordinary tale,told for the first time, of the black legal establishment, forced literally to invent itself before it could join the fight, then patiently assembling, in courtroom after courtroom, a body of law that would serve to free its people from thralldom to unjust laws. Heroes abound, some obscure, like Charles Houston (who built Howard Law School into a rigorous academy for black lawyers) and the Reverend J.A. DeLaine (the minister-teacher who, despite bitter opposition, organized and led the first crucial fight for educational equality in the Jim Crow South), others like Thurgood Marshall, justly famous - but all of whose passionate devotion proved intense enough to match their mission.<br><br>Reading&nbsp;<i>Simple Justice</i>, we see how black Americans' groundswell urge for fair treatment collides with the intransigence of white supremacists in a grinding legal campaign that inevitably found its way to the halls and chambers of the Supreme Court for a final showdown.&nbsp; Kluger searches out and analyzes what went on there during the months of hearings and deliberations, often behind closed doors, laying bare the doubts,disagreements, and often deeply held convictions of the nine Justices.He shows above all how Chief Justice Earl Warren, new to the Court but old in the ways of politics, achieved the impossible - a unanimous decision to reverse the 58-year-old false doctrine of "separate but equal" education for blacks. Impeccably researched and elegantly written, this may be the most revealing report ever published of America's highest court at work.<br>Based on extensive interviews and both published and unpublished documentary sources,&nbsp;<i>Simple Justice</i>&nbsp;has the lineaments of an epic. It will stand as the classic study of a turning point in our history.</p><p>&#34;An extraordinary research effort....Kluger has written three distinct books within one jacket. The first is an account of race relations in America. The second is a detailed study of the complex process--the litigation strategy--by which the five consolidated cases that we know as Brown arose and worked their way up to the Supreme Court. The third is a meticulously researched account of the process within the Supreme Court by which the Brown decision was reached.&#34;--Harvard Law ReviewNo decision by the Supreme Court of the United States has had a more profound effect on the conscience of the American people than its ruling in <i>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka,</i> on May 17, 1954.<i> </i>Stunning in its unanimity and moral clarity, the ruling transformed race relations in the United States by holding that the legally enforced separation of its black and white children in schools&#x2013;and, by extension, of the races in all other public settings&#x2013;was no longer tolerable. The Court&#x2019;s opinion climaxed a twenty-year struggle by a band of courageous African American plaintiffs and their resolute attorneys who labeled segregation for what it was, a caste system that betrayed U.S. ideals of human equality. Within months of the Justices&#x2019; verdict, the civil-rights movement was under way. <br><br><i>Simple Justice, </i>rich<i> </i>in personal drama and deft in connecting the complex social issues at stake, is the definitive account of the legal battle that after three centuries at last awarded black Americans equal protection under the law by finding the old &#x201c;separate but equal&#x201d; doctrine to be a contradiction. The forced separation of black schoolchildren solely because of their race, the nation&#x2019;s highest court declared, &#x201c;generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.&#x201d; <br><br>Pulitzer Prize&#x2014;winner Richard Kluger explores the epochal <i>Brown</i> ruling from its legal and cultural roots, dwelling as well on the lives of those who led the long, bitter, and often disillusioning fight. Here is a sweeping narrative that treats the law not as some lofty abstraction but as an imperfect, and at times vexing, daily presence in a racially divided nation. We meet the men, women, and youngsters who overcame their fears and disadvantages to defy the mean spirit of Jim Crow. They were inspired by a remarkable group of black lawyers who practically invented civil-rights law by patiently assembling, in the courtroom and in the face of constant intimidation, a case so compelling that in the end it could not be denied. <br><br>Kluger brilliantly searches out and reveals how the <i>Brown</i> decision was shaped&#x2013;behind closed doors&#x2013;by the clash of principles and personalities within the Supreme Court over the three years the Justices considered the monumental case. The outcome reflected, above all, the unflinching will of Chief Justice Earl Warren, new to the Court but old in the ways of politics, who unified his robed brethren behind a simple but immensely powerful message to the nation. <br><br>For this revised edition of <i>Simple Justice,</i> marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Court&#x2019;s ruling, the author has added a final chapter that weighs the far-reaching impact of the case on American society over the past half century and finds that while true racial harmony and equality continue to elude the United States, there is more reason for hopeful celebration than dark despair. This is a vitally important work of American history.</p><h2>SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL</h2><p>Still provocative after all these years, Helen Gurley Brown celebrates the pleasures of flirting, of enjoying affairs from beginning to end, throwing brunches and dinner parties, finding men where you might not think to look, dating (and ditching) married men, and being both feminine and powerful.</p><p></p><h2>The Market for Liberty</h2><p>LARGE PRINT EDITION! More at LargePrintLiberty.com.<br> <br> Some great books are the product of a lifetime of research, reflection, and labored discipline. But other classics are written in a white heat during the moment of discovery, with prose that shines forth like the sun pouring into the window of a time when a new understanding brings in the world into focus for the first time.<br> <br> "The Market for Liberty" is that second type of classic, and what a treasure it is. Written by two authors-Morris and Linda Tannehill-just following a period of intense study of the writings of both Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard, it has the pace, energy, and rigor you would expect from an evening's discussion with either of these two giants.<br> <br> More than that, these authors put pen to paper at precisely the right time in their intellectual development, that period rhapsodic freshness when a great truth had been revealed, and they had to share it with the world. Clearly, the authors fell in love with liberty and the free market, and wrote an engaging, book-length sonnet to these ideas.<br> <br> This book is very radical in the true sense of that term: it gets to the root of the problem of government and provides a rethinking of the whole organization of society. They start at the beginning with the idea of the individual and his rights, work their way through exchange and the market, expose government as the great enemy of mankind, and then-and here is the great surprise-they offer a dramatic expansion of market logic into areas of security and defense provision.<br> <br> Their discussion of this controversial topic is integrated into their libertarian theoretical apparatus. It deals with private arbitration agencies in managing with disputes and criminality, the role of insurers in providing profitable incentives for security, and private agencies in their capacity as protection services. It's for this reason that Hoppe calls this book an "outstanding yet much neglected analysis of the operation of competition."</p><p>The following is the Foreword by Karl Hess. <p> The most interesting political questions throughout history have been whether or not humans will be ruled or free, whether they will be responsible for their actions as individuals or left irresponsible as members of society, and whether they can live in peace by volitional agreements alone. </p><p> The fundamental question of politics has always been whether there should be politics. </p><p> Morris and Linda Tannehill, in this book, which has become something of a classic even while being (until now) out of print, answer that politics is not necessary, that the ancient and ongoing contrivance of the marketplace can be substituted for it with ennobling results. </p><p> Advocates of state power will of course recoil from the idea and point out that it is all idle dreaming, that the state has always existed and must always exist lest brutal humans descend into, horrors, anarchy. They are correct, of course. Without the state there would be anarchy for that is, despite all of the perfervid ravings of the Marxist Left and statist Right, all that anarchy means--the absence of the state, the opportunity for liberty. </p><p> As for the direction that a world headed for liberty would be taking (descending or ascending) the Tannehills and many others have reviewed the record of the nation state and have discovered a curiously powerful fact. The nation state has never been associated with peace on earth. Its most powerful recommendation and record is, as a matter of fact, as a wager of war. The history of nation states is written around the dates of wars, not peace, around arms and not arts. The organization of warfare without the coercive power of the nation state is simply unimaginable at the scale with which we have become familiar. </p><p> Having shown no capacity whatsoever to bring peace to earth, then what is the claim of the state on our allegiance? In closely reasoned arguments, the Tannehills maintain that there should be no claim at all; that the state is not needed at any point in our lives and that other, volitional, arrangements can be substituted for every single state function. They see these arrangements operating in the framework of a truly free market and they carefully explain them.</p>The fundamental question of politics has always been whether there should be politics. Morris and Linda Tannehill, in this book, which has become something of a classic even while being (until now) out of print, answer that politics is not necessary, that the ancient and ongoing contrivance of the marketplace can be substituted for it with ennobling results. -- <i>Karl Hess, author of <i>Capitalism for Kids</i></i></p><h2>Talking Back To Prozac: What Doctors Aren&#39;t Telling You About Today&#39;s Most Controversial Drug</h2><p>Millions of Americans are on it to treat everything from serious depression to shyness, obesity, PMS, and back pain.

From the marketing of the banana as the first fast food, to the company&#x2019;s involvement in an invasion of Honduras, the Bay of Pigs crisis, and a bloody coup in Guatemala, Chapman weaves a dramatic tale of big business, political deceit, and outright violence to show how one company wreaked havoc in the banana republics&#x201d; of Central America, and how terrifyingly similar the age of United Fruit is to our age of rapid globalization.</p><p><p>Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley</p><p>A climactic scene in Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez's masterpiece, One Hundred Years of Solitude, takes place during a strike by Colombian banana workers when armed forces acting at the behest of "the banana company" herd 3,000 people into the town square of Macondo and open fire on them: </p><p>"The captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machine guns answered at once. But it all seemed like a farce. It was as if the machine guns had been loaded with caps, because their panting rattle could be heard and their incandescent spitting could be seen, but not the slightest reaction was perceived, not a cry, not even a sigh among the compact crowd that seemed petrified by an instantaneous invulnerability. Suddenly, on one side of the station, a cry of death tore open the enchantment: 'Aaaagh, Mother'. . . . They were penned in, swirling about in a gigantic whirlwind that little by little was being reduced to its epicenter as the edges were systematically being cut off all around like an onion being peeled by the insatiable and methodical shears of the machine guns." </p><p>The only survivor is a boy, who lives to tell "with precise and convincing details how the army had machine-gunned more than three thousand workers penned up by the station and how they loaded the bodies into a two-hundred-car train and threw them into the sea." The terrible scene is fiction, but it is based in fact; indeed, Living to Tell the Tale is the title Garc�a M�rquez gave to his memoir, published in 2003. In December 1928, Colombian Army troops, acting in the interests of the United Fruit Company, opened fire on striking workers in the town of Ci�naga, near the author's native town, Aracataca. He was only a few months old at the time, but the story of the massacre was told over and over and worked its way into the core of his memory, just as stories of the Civil War became central to the consciousness of William Faulkner. </p><p>Garc�a M�rquez significantly overstated the number of dead -- the count has long been in dispute, with estimates ranging from 47 to 2,000 -- but he in no way underplayed the importance of the slaughter in 20th-century Latin American history. In the minds of millions, it came to symbolize the tyrannical role of United Fruit in the region and to cast the company as the leading actor in what came to be known as "Yankee imperialism" in "banana republics." Though many other depredations were committed by or in the name of United Fruit, which was commonly known as El Pulpo, "the octopus," this one quickly entered Latin America's psyche and has remained there ever since. </p><p>Peter Chapman, in this once-over-very-lightly history of United Fruit, gives the massacre only a few paragraphs. This is scarcely surprising in the context of the rest of the book, which can be called a work of history only in the most permissive sense of the term, but it's very surprising in the context of Chapman's determination to bash United Fruit -- and by extension the United States -- at every turn. Bananas -- in England it was published as Jungle Capitalists: A Story of Globalisation, Greed and Revolution -- is basically a rant, so one would think that the bloodbath in Ci�naga would have inspired him to heights of indignation, yet his description of it barely rides above the perfunctory. </p><p>Chapman is a British journalist who has covered Latin America in print and on air, and now writes for the Financial Times, including a blog about sports. His previous book, The Goalkeeper's History of Britain, was well-received, which makes the shortcomings of Bananas all the more disappointing and unexpected -- especially its prose, which is utterly lifeless, even when Chapman attempts to flay United Fruit and the many other malefactors who populate these pages. </p><p>United Fruit, Chapman claims, "set the template for capitalism, the first of the modern multi-nationals." It "started with a few bananas grown at the side of a railway line and became a global power." It "was greedy and controlled millions of acres of land, only a relatively small part of which it used. In countries of many landless small farmers, it kept the rest to keep out competitors and for a 'rainy day.' In and around its plantations it had fifteen hundred miles of railways, a good number of which its host countries built and paid for." Its "Great White Fleet of refrigerated ships, 'reefers', comprised the world's largest private navy." Et cetera. Chapman's determination to tar United Fruit with the brush of multinational rapaciousness knows no end: </p><p>"Like multi-national companies today, United Fruit made alliances when and where it could to survive. It sought out malleable elements: politicians with whom it could cut a deal and presidents-in-exile awaiting their call to sail back to power. United Fruit might even help find a boat. Its efforts showed that as long as it did not unduly offend the contemporary mores of its home base, then it could probably get away with much overseas. Its levels of bribery in Honduras in the 1920s did prompt a debate in the US Congress, which concluded that that was the way business was done in such parts of the world." </p><p>The company came into being in March 1899, under the leadership of Andrew Preston as president and Minor Keith as vice-president, but it was Keith who really ran this "brooding presence across six lands: Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Cuba, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic." Others eventually were absorbed in its grasp, most notably Honduras, where a military coup in 1911 -- engineered by United Fruit with the complicity of the United States -- brought into power a government friendly to the company's interests and established "conspiracy and violence" as important weapons in its control of the region. </p><p>All of this is beyond dispute, though whether Chapman has got all the details right must be left to scholars of Latin American history. United Fruit had much to do with introducing "banana republic" and "gunboat diplomacy" into the English language, and even more to do with establishing many Latin American countries as client states that did the company's, and Washington's, bidding. It isn't a pretty story, and the persistent success of left-wing and populist demagogues in Latin America leaves no doubt that the combination of United Fruit's greed and Washington's ill-considered policies established anti-Americanism as a powerful political force south of the border. Only now, as Washington reaches south with free-trade agreements, does much of Latin America look north with more friendly eyes, but the myopia of the present Congress with regard to these agreements puts that in jeopardy. There is ample reason to fear that Hugo Ch�vez is not the last of his breed. </p><p>In this sense, Chapman gets it more or less right. But his arguments about United Fruit and multinational corporations are shakier. For one thing, United Fruit was unable to sustain its empire. Eventually it was brought down by mismanagement, antitrust actions, competition, changed political circumstances here and to the south, and diseased bananas. Its successor, Chiquita, is by Chapman's admission no more than a "surviving remnant." United Fruit may have been an international corporate monopoly for a long time, but eventually it collapsed, which should serve as an object lesson in the vulnerability of businesses that operate in lawless and wholly self-serving ways. </p><p>Beyond that, Chapman skips too lightly over the difference in international business then and now. To be sure there still are companies that exploit the human and natural resources of foreign countries, especially in the Third World, and that use lobbying and political contributions for highly questionable ends. That, to paraphrase Chapman, is the way business is done in this and other parts of the world, an unpleasant but inescapable reality. But the multinationals aren't all malevolent, and they must answer to more stringent laws than United Fruit ever faced. Contrary to what Chapman would have us believe, there aren't any United Fruits today, which isn't an apology for the multinationals but a simple statement of fact. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

She lives in southern Wisconsin.Poor grammar, weak imagery and rickety old plots dressed up as Matters of Import doom this series of novellas, a continuation of Weis and Hickman's popular Dragon Lance series. As before, the protagonists are heroic; the revelation here is that the evil forces (who lost the War of the Lance some 20 years ago) are now organizing themselves into The Knights of Takhisis and employing the tactics once used to defeat them. They will be led, or not, by Steel Brightblade (the son of Kitiara, a disciple of evil in the last war) and Sturm (the hero in the last war). Action focuses on uninspired tales of Caramon Majere's son Palin's quest to be a wizard and political unrest among the Elves, which threatens the possibility of hegemony. There's hardly any suspense since contrivances make it clear that the eventual victory will be by authorial fiat. Descriptions are repeated three or four times, often within paragraphs of each other--and little of it deserves close attention.

An influential and successful Chicago artist, he possessed a "singular vision," according to Courtney Graham Donnell, a contributor to this well produced volume. A master technician, Albright created meticulously detailed paintings, sculpted, carved his own frames, and devised a number of innovative techniques to explore his fascination with perception. A positive, energetic, and fun-loving man, he nonetheless painted dark and troubling portraits that focus, unnervingly, on decay, aging, and death. Albright wrote, "The body is our tomb," and admitted that he liked to make viewers uncomfortable by challenging their notions of art, beauty, and life. An artist with the unusual distinction of having one of his paintings star in a film, his <i>Portrait of Dorian Gray</i> (1943), Albright should be better known, and, with this outstanding monograph accompanying the striking exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, he will be. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Dada Surrealism and Their Heritage</h2><p>Rubin, William S.

A dealer in wool, sacred pictures, spices, and iron, he established an import/export house with branches in Pisa, Genoa, Barcelona and Majorca. He also left behind, in wooden crates, the entire archive of his business - over 150,000 letters, some 500 ledgers and accounts books, and a mass of personal and business documents that Iris Origo tracked down, translated, and, through patient selection and perfect understanding, made accessible to the modern reader in this award-winning and singular biography.<br>In her fine introduction, Barbara Tuchman asks, "Why is this book one of the great books of historical writing of the twentieth century?" She answers, "[Origo's] success in resurrecting not only a personality whom we can recognize but also his times, his town, his marriage, his household, his country home, his friends and associates, makes for a work of extraordinary interest with that quality to grip and take hold of a reader that makes a book everlasting." And as for Datini himself, the epicenter of this remarkable historical recreation, she writes, "the story of his achievement is something more signifcant than the mere record of the enrichment of a single man. In the extent and variety of his ventures, in his powers of organization, in his international outlook, in his swift adaptability to a society in turmoil, as in his own ambition, shrewdness, tenacity, anxiety, and greed, he is the forerunner of the businessman of today."</p><p></p><h2>True Sisters</h2><p><p>In a novel based on true events, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Sandra Dallas delivers the story of four women---seeking the promise of salvation and prosperity in a new land---who come together on a harrowing journey. </p><p><br>In 1856, Mormon converts, encouraged by Brigham Young himself, and outfitted with two-wheeled handcarts, set out on foot from Iowa City to Salt Lake City, the <i>promised land</i>.

It was late in the day, and they had been ready for hours, had stood there behind the spindly cart that was piled with all their worldly goods, listening for the command or maybe the sound of the cornet that would send them on their way. Already, the horn ordered their lives, waking them at five in the morning, calling them to prayers twice a day, sounding again at ten at night for the fires and lights to be extinguished. For three weeks, their lives had been ordered by that clarion call, and the sisters thought it had grown a little tiresome. But now the young women strained their ears for the sound, hoping the notes would begin the procession.<br>&#x201c;Will the horn start us off, Andrew? Will it, do ye think?&#x201d; Ella Buck called to her husband, who stood between the two shafts, ready to pick up the crossbar. At nineteen, Ella was the elder of the two women, and taller&#x2014;an inch taller and a year older than her sister, although the two looked as much alike as two roses on a bush, both plump, round-faced, with hair the color of straw at dusk, hair that curled into ringlets in the damp Iowa air.<br>&#x201c;Och! I told ye I dinna know,&#x201d; Andrew replied. It was the same answer he&#x2019;d given his wife a few minutes earlier and once before that, and he sounded put out this time.<br>&#x201c;Why do we skitter about? We are three weeks late,&#x201d; Ella continued, ignoring her husband&#x2019;s tone. &#x201c;Why couldna we hae left at dawn?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I dinna know, I say. You&#x2019;ve small patience. There&#x2019;s a reason we haena started. Ye can count on it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What reason?&#x201d; Nannie Macintosh, Ella&#x2019;s sister, asked.<br>Andrew didn&#x2019;t answer, perhaps because he didn&#x2019;t know, or maybe he was afraid that his own impatience would show. After all, he had awakened them before the first sounding of the cornet and insisted they eat a cold breakfast so they would be ready to go at dawn. Now, he picked up the crossbar that was connected to the two shafts of the handcart and began to examine it. There was a knot in it, and Andrew told his wife that he hoped the wood wouldn&#x2019;t split before they reached Zion.<br>The cart was made of green wood. They were all constructed of green wood, and put together by the Saints themselves. The handcarts were to have been waiting for them when the converts arrived from Europe, but to Nannie&#x2019;s disappointment, they weren&#x2019;t, and the men had gone looking for seasoned lumber, only there wasn&#x2019;t any. So the carpenters among them fashioned the handcarts themselves from the poor wood that was available, made them to the Prophet Brigham Young&#x2019;s own instructions, to look like the carts the peddlers and dustmen pushed in the cities at home. While a few of the travelers had carts covered with canvas hoods, Andrew had been assigned an open cart with two wooden wheels, some four feet in diameter, with hoop-iron tires. The vehicle was the width of a wagon track so that it could roll along easily on the ruts of the trails. Between the wheels was a sort of wagon box or platform made of four or five planks, about three feet wide and four feet long, to hold bedding, cooking utensils, clothing, flour, and other provisions that Nannie and Ella stored there. The planks were nailed to two frame pieces that extended forward to form the shafts. Fastened to the two shafts was a crossbar. The space between the shafts accommodated two persons, but Andrew would pull the cart himself, while the women pushed. The cart, empty, weighed sixty-five pounds.<br>Andrew had said that the handcarts were a brilliant idea, proposed by the prophet himself, that allowed even the poorest among them to make the journey to the Great Salt Lake Valley. Andrew, Ella, and Nannie never could have paid for the trip to the Promised Land if they&#x2019;d had to lay out three hundred dollars for a team and wagon. But a handcart for the three of them cost less than twenty dollars, and what&#x2019;s more, the church loaned them the money for the journey, which they would pay back once they were settled in Utah and Andrew found work.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t just the cost, however. The three emigrants knew that the carts would make the trip faster than any wagon, because the people would not have to worry about livestock&#x2014;hitching up the oxen each morning, gathering feed, hunting for the animals if they wandered off. Moreover, the handcarts wouldn&#x2019;t have to carry all the supplies needed to reach the valley, since resupply stations would be set up along the way. So with the other Saints, they could average fifteen miles a day across the thirteen hundred miles of prairie and mountains from Iowa City to the valley. That meant a trip of less than three months.<br>&#x201c;But we canna walk all that way? I&#x2019;ve never walked more than five miles at a time, and down a country lane outside Edinburgh at that. How can ye ask it?&#x201d; Ella had inquired when she first heard about the carts.<br>&#x201c;The exercise and the fresh air will strengthen you,&#x201d; the missionary speaking to the gathering in Scotland had replied.<br>&#x201c;What if I get taken in sickness or break my leg and hae to hirple?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There will be wagons for the lame and infirm as well as the elderly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m...&#x201d; Embarrassed, she looked down at her stomach, which was still as flat as a flatiron.<br>&#x201c;Of no consequence, sister. Other women, much further along, have crossed the prairie, some all the way to California. And as I told you, there will be the wagons for those who can&#x2019;t walk.&#x201d;<br>Ella discovered in Iowa City that there were only seven wagons, filled now with supplies and freight, for the infirm among the 650 emigrants, however. Still, Ella believed the elder who had spoken, since this group&#x2014;called the Martin Company, for its leader, Edward Martin, a Mormon missionary who had served in England and Scotland&#x2014;was the last of the five handcart companies to cross the prairie that year. The Willie Company had left two weeks earlier, not long after Andrew, Ella, and Nannie arrived. Ella said the shortage of wagons must mean that the elders were sure in the knowledge that few fell sick on the Overland Trail. The Lord would give them strength, a missionary promised her. As Ella stood behind the cart, waiting for the signal to move, examining a splinter that had worked its way into her hand, she thought again of walking the hundreds of miles and hoped the missionary was right.<br>The sisters heard shouts then, a creaking as the first carts, some lined up on the road, others spread out across the prairie, moved forward in a jumble, cries as parents called to their children, shouts of praise to the Lord, a few prayers. Ella had thought they would move out with a song, a trill of the cornet, a flash of lightning, or a boom of thunder rolling across the prairie, something to herald the momentous occasion, but there was nothing. With no ceremony at all, the first carts began to move, and then the ones behind them.<br>&#x201c;Andrew,&#x201d; Ella called.<br>&#x201c;I can see,&#x201d; he said, although he had been studying the poor piece of wood in his hand instead of watching the line of carts. Now he looked up at the procession of conveyances in front of him, his face as open and shining as the sun above them, and turned to his wife and her sister. All traces of impatience gone, he grinned and called, &#x201c;Ready to roll on, are ye? Ready to roll to Zion?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; Ella and Nannie cried, and as Andrew strained to push the crossbar, the two women leaned hard against the back of the cart, and the awkward wheels began to move.<br>Ella and Nannie smiled broadly at each other, and the older girl touched her sister&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;You will love it in Zion. Wait and see. Ye&#x2019;ll be with God&#x2019;s people. No one will jeer at us, call us dirty Mormons.

Before a year is out, ye&#x2019;ll wear them.&#x201d; Ella stumbled a little as the wheel of the cart bounced over a rock, then checked to make sure that nothing had fallen out. She looked up at the dozens of carts in front of them, the dozens behind, and caught the eye of a woman pushing a handcart with a little girl perched on the top, thinking she would remember the woman, remember the day, July 28, 1856. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re off,&#x201d; Ella shouted above the din.<br>The woman didn&#x2019;t smile, but she shouted back, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re off to the Salt Lake indeed!&#x201d;<br>Ella looked again at her sister. &#x201c;I shouldna hae said that about the shoon. If your boots wear out, ye&#x2019;ll need the slippers before we reach Utah.&#x201d;<br>Nannie shook her head, her round cheeks already red from the exertion. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re for my wedding. I won&#x2019;t wear them until I&#x2019;m married, even if I hae to cross the mountains barefoot. That&#x2019;s why I bought them. And if I never marry, why then, the shoon will never be worn.&#x201d;<br>Ella turned away, hoping her sister had not seen her eyes cloud over with pity. The shoes had been bought for Nannie&#x2019;s wedding. She had been betrothed to Levi Kirkwood, a shopkeeper from London. They had set a date, and Nannie had made her wedding dress, gray silk with a sprinkling of red flowers, then lavished a week&#x2019;s wages from her job as a chambermaid on the shoes, fragile red silk with kid bottoms that would not survive half a dozen wearings. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put them on for my wedding, then set them away and wear them again on our fiftieth anniversary.

Howard's The Soil and Health became a seminal and inspirational text in the organic movement soon after its publication in 1945. The Soil and Health argues that industrial agriculture, emergent in Howard's era and dominant today, disrupts the delicate balance of nature and irrevocably robs the soil of its fertility. Howard's classic treatise links the burgeoning health crises facing crops, livestock, and humanity to this radical degradation of the Earth's soil. His message&#x2015;that we must respect and restore the health of the soil for the benefit of future generations&#x2015;still resonates among those who are concerned about the effects of chemically enhanced agriculture.</p><p>WITH A NEW INTRODUCTION BY WENDELL BERRYSir Albert Howard (1873&#x2013;1947), founder of the organic farming movement, is the author of several books, including An Agricultural Testament.</p><h2>The Case of the One-Eyed Killer Stud Horse (Hank the Cowdog)</h2><p>A wild and ornery one-eyed killer horse is destroying the ranch.

But Simenon (1903-89) left behind so many sources--a massive autobiography, 21 volumes of memoirs, and several earlier autobiographical sketches and novels-- that Marnham defines his job, with undue modesty, largely as referee to the phenomenally productive author's many versions of his life. The facts of Simenon's life are as florid as any biographer could wish. Self-taught reporter and columnist at age 15; intimate of Josephine Baker and Maurice Vlaminck; bestselling (500 million copies) author of over 200 novels (76 featuring Inspector Maigret) and 188 additional potboilers (written with a working vocabulary of 2,000 words); self-confessed lover of 10,000 women; recipient of tributes from fellow authors as diverse as Thornton Wilder, Henry Miller, and Andr&#x201a; Gide--the public events of Simenon's life are fabulous. But Marnham is at his best not in detailing Simenon's successes but in illuminating the relation between his gray, guilt-ridden fiction and his tormented family life--whether the family is that of his adored father and despised mother; his complaisant first wife, R&#x201a;gine, and his long-time mistress, Boule; or his calculating second wife, Denyse, and the string of domestic helpers who doubled as paramours. Though Marnham gets bogged down in overprecise parallels between Simenon's family problems and particular novels, his easy command of his subject's life and work allows him not only to select among competing versions of the truth but to generalize with authority about Simenon's inveterate habit of fictionalizing his own life, so that ``his account of the experience became part of the experience''--especially the experience of categorical rejection (both of and by Simenon), which Marnham sees as decisive for an understanding of the man and his work. A biographical study that goes a long way toward illuminating the mystery of Simenon's life in fiction while fostering a healthy respect for that irreducible mystery--the process by which Simenon kept obsessively reinventing himself.

In an afterword to this new edition, the author examines "third way" leadership as it has been practiced by Bill Clinton and others. These leaders are neither great repudiators nor orthodox innovators. They challenge received political categories, mix seemingly antithetical doctrines, and often take their opponents' issues as their own. As the 1996 election confirmed, third way leadership has great electoral appeal. The question is whether Clinton in his second term will escape the convulsive end so often associated with the type. </p></p><p><b>Stephen Skowronek</b> is Professor of Political Science at Yale University. He is the author of <i>Building a New American State: The Expansion of National Administrative Capacities, 1877-1920</i>.Skowronek...brings illuminating insights to each president that he discusses...A major theoretical contribution to the study of the presidency. -- Richard M. Pious &#34;Political Science Quarterly&#34; A work of great insight...This is a book that kicks aside all the conventional ways of thinking about presidential leadership and erects a daring, powerful, analytic machine that compels attention. -- Hugh Heclo &#34;George Mason University&#34; In evaluating the field of political authority, Skowronek skillfully and systematically makes use of historical evidence. His approach can only be applauded as it brings a new and broader understanding of the historical evolution of the presidency. -- Birgitte Nielsen &#34;American Studies in Scandinavia&#34; In this pathbreaking work, Stephen Skowronek escapes from &#39;secular time&#39; to view presidents in what he calls political time, &#39; meaning incumbents&#39; relationships to their predecessors and to the status quo...This rich, insightful, resonant volume merits reading and rereading. It is destined to be a classic of presidential scholarship. -- Gil Troy &#34;Journal of American History&#34; This is a remarkable book...A skilled practitioner of the use of historical evidence systematically to understand not only the evolution, but also the current nature, of American political institutions, �Skowronek� examines the whole crowded history of the presidency to catalog and organize the two hundred year experience in a fresh and striking fashion. -- Joel Silbey &#34;Review of Politics&#34; Stephen Skowronek&#39;s much awaited book relating cycles of the US presidency to what the author has previously called political time&#39; is an instant conversation piece. &#34;The Politics Presidents Make&#34; is a book that will engage scholars of political leadership and, particularly, those of the US presidency with its categories and its arguments. It is also easy to imagine that this book will evoke theological debates. -- Bert A. Rockman &#34;Governance&#34; The book brings together current ideas of political scientists on the theory of presidential leadership, as well as incorporating the major historical works on the various presidents. It is history from the top rather than from the bottom, and while current historical trends are in the opposite direction, this sophisticated, scholarly analysis of presidential leadership illustrates that the history of political leadership is a subject on which innovative, imaginative approaches can still produce important new perspectives. -- Peter G. Boyle &#34;The Americas&#34; A magisterial work, one of the most important studies of the presidency--indeed, of American politics--ever written...�Skowronek� comes very close to identifying the root problem affecting presidents...This is the all-important fact that the Constitution is unchanging and nondeveloped, while at all times intersecting with a social, economic, and political world that has undergone incessant development from the beginning. The whole work may be read as an extended, powerful, and penetrating meditation on some of the global consequences of this fact. -- Walter Dean Burnham &#34;American Political Science Review&#34; Indeed, Skowronek&#39;s work has been recognized as a major contribution to our understanding of the office... Skowronek provides a mass of detailed evidence to support his thesis, but he is also sensitive to the fact that no one theoretical perspective can account for the complexity and nuance of presidential leadership... Above all, his work retains a deep respect for the Neustadtian tradition with its emphasis on the leadership capacities of individual incumbents, while placing presidential performance through time in a analytically persuasive theoretical context. -- David McKay &#34;Government and Opposition&#34;</p><h2>The Great Wave: The Influence of Japanese Woodcuts on French Prints</h2><p>4to, cloth. 112 pp, 114 illustrations (24 in color), bibliography.</p><p></p><h2>Crown of Stars (Crown of Stars, Vol. 7)</h2><p>In the wake of the cataclysm many new alliances are forming even as old ones dissolve.

Reprint.</p><p>John Ringo is author of the New York Times best-selling Legacy of Aldenata (Posleen War) series, which so far includes A Hymn Before Battle and nine sequels, the technothriller series starting with Ghost, a dark fantasy titled Princess of Wands, and many other novels for Baen. A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, Ringo brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction.This latest in a series depicting the invasion of our galaxy by a rapacious alien species isn't as much fun as its predecessors, A Hymn Before Battle and Gust Front. Unfortunately, as Ringo, a military affairs adviser to Fox News, indicates in his afterword, what was escapist entertainment before 9/11 no longer provides the same escape. Five years after the Posleen made their first landings, most of the world lies under their control. By squandering precious resources, the leaders of North America have contained the enemy to several bridgeheads. Major Mike O'Neal commands the only force capable of engaging the Posleen in a war of maneuver. Even "Mighty Mite" O'Neal despairs of victory, as clueless politicians and self-serving "allies" cause his soldiers to die in battle against hopeless odds. We were living in a Golden Age, muses O'Neal, before the Posleen came, and he struggles to prevent his troops from becoming mere killing machines by keeping alive the memory of what was once and might be again. Despite the novel's somber tone, there's hope that the schemes of our supposed allies to see the Posleen and us destroy one another may fail. For thoughtful readers, Ringo raises some tough and highly relevant questions about the conflicts of interest between Americans and allies who don't share our ideas of individual dignity and freedom and about our leaders' inability to advance beyond narrow parochial interests toward the common good.

Then, the body of a student is found buried in the sand, and the boy&#x2019;s influential father demands that Scotland Yard investigate. Adam Dalgleish, the son of a parson, once spent happy summers at the school. A detective who loves poetry, a man who has known loss and discovery, Dalgliesh is the perfect candidate to look for the truth in a remote, rarified community of the faithful&#x2013;and the frightened. For when one death leads to another, Dalgliesh finds himself steeped in a world of good and evil, of stifled passions and hidden pasts, where someone has cause not just to commit one crime, but to begin an unholy order of murder. . . . <br><b><br></b></p><p>Despite challenges from Ruth Rendell and (more recently) Minette Walters, P.D. James's position as Britain's Queen of Crime remains largely unassailable. Although a certain reaction has set in to her reputation (and there are those who claim her poetry-loving copper Adam Dalgliesh doesn't correspond to any of his counterparts in the real world), her detractors can scarcely deny her astonishing literary gifts. More than any other writer, she has elevated the detective story into the realms of literature, with the psychology of the characters treated in the most complex and authoritative fashion. Her plots, too, are full of intriguing detail and studed with brilliantly observed character studies. Who cares if Dalgliesh belongs more in the pages of a book than poking around a graffiti-scrawled council estate? As a policeman, he is considerably more plausible than Doyle's Holmes, and that's never stopped us loving the Baker Street sleuth. <i>Death in Holy Orders</i> represents something of a challenge from James to her critics, taking on all the contentious elements and rigorously reinvigorating them. She had admitted that she was finding it increasingly difficult to find new plots for Dalgliesh, and the locale here (a theological college on a lonely stretch of the East Anglian coast) turns out to be an inspired choice. We're presented with the enclosed setting so beloved of golden age detective writers, and James is able to incorporate her theological interests seamlessly into the plot (but never in any doctrinaire way; the nonbeliever is never uncomfortable). The body of a student at the college is found on the shore, suffocated by a fall of sand. Dalgliesh is called upon to reexamine the verdict of accidental death (which the student's father would not accept). Having visited the College of St. Anselm in his boyhood, he finds the investigation has a strong nostalgic aspect for him. But that is soon overtaken by the realization that he has encountered the most horrific case of his career, and another visitor to the college dies a horrible death. As an exploration of evil--and as a piece of highly distinctive crime writing--this is James at her nonpareil best. Dalgliesh, too, is rendered with new dimensions of psychological complexity. <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i>10 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Wordly Wise 3000 Book 2, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Summary:<br>0<br><br>About the Author:<br><br>�0<br>Author: Kenneth^Adams&nbsp;Hodkinson<br>Illustrator:0<br>Publisher:0<br>Published Date:03/30/2007<br>Format:Paperback<br>ISBN:0838828205<br>#of pages:#N/A<br></p><p></p><h2>The Myth of Islamic Tolerance: How Islamic Law Treats Non-Muslims</h2><p>This collection of essays by some of the world's leading authorities on Islamic social history focuses on the juridical and cultural oppression of non-Muslims in Islamic societies. The authors of these in-depth but accessible articles explode the widely diffused myth, promulgated by Muslim advocacy groups, of a largely tolerant, pluralistic Islam. In fact, the contributors lay bare the oppressive legal superstructure that has treated non-Muslims in Muslim societies as oppressed and humiliated tributaries, and they show the devastating effects of these discriminatory attitudes and practices in both past and contemporary global conflicts.Besides original articles, primary source documents here presented also elucidate how the legally mandated subjugation of non-Muslims under Islamic law stems from the Muslim concept of jihad &#x2015; the spread of Islam through conquest. Historically, the Arab-Muslim conquerors overran vast territories containing diverse non-Muslim populations. Many of these conquered people surrendered to Muslim domination under a special treaty called dhimma in Arabic. As such these non-Muslim indigenous populations, mainly Christians and Jews, were then classified under Islamic law as dhimmis (meaning "protected"). Although protected status may sound benign, this classification in fact referred to "protection" from the resumption of the jihad against non-Muslims, pending their adherence to a system of legal and financial oppression, as well as social isolation. The authors maintain that underlying this religious caste system is a culturally ingrained contempt for outsiders that still characterizes much of the Islamic world today and is a primary impetus for jihad terrorism.Also discussed is the poll tax (Arabic jizya) levied on non-Muslims; the Islamic critique of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the use of jihad ideology by twentieth-century radical Muslim theorists; and other provocative topics usually ignored by Muslim apologists.This hard-hitting and absorbing critique of Islamic teachings and practices regarding non-Muslim minorities exposes a significant human rights scandal that rarely receives any mention either in academic circles or in the mainstream press.</p><p>This enlightening collection of essays by some of the world's leading authorities on Islamic social history focuses on the pervasive legal and cultural oppression of non-Muslims in Islamic societies.

Although protected status may sound benign, this classification in fact referred, most importantly, to "protection" from the resumption of the jihad against non-Muslims. The authors maintain that underlying this religious caste system is a culturally ingrained contempt for outsiders that still characterizes much of the Islamic world today and is a primary catalyst for jihad terrorism, jihadist-martyrdom bombers, and a Nazi-like racist antisemitism taught in school systems and propagated via the media. </p><p>Included are Ibn Warraq writing about Edward Said and the "intellectual turbans" he has placed on today's academic establishment, forestalling honest discussion about Islamic tolerance; Bat Ye'or on the devastating effects of the dhimma, the system that actually defines the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims in Islamic states; Walid Phares on the little-noted oppression of Middle Eastern Christians; and much more--including a devastating series of articles by UN expert David G. Littman on the advancement of Islamic intolerance at the United Nations and other provocative topics usually ignored by Muslim apologists. </p><p>This hard-hitting and absorbing assessment of Islamic teachings and practices regarding non-Muslim minorities uncovers a significant human rights scandal that rarely receives any mention either in academic circles or in the mainstream press.</p>Robert Spencer is a freelance writer, the director of Jihad Watch, and an adjunct fellow of the Free Congress Foundation.

And in this extraordinary book, he introduces the reader to the joys of real cooking - and, in the end, to the joys of real living. The act of cooking - no less than the act of living - must be savored for itself. (Also to be savored: the tasty variety of Father Capon&#39;s recipes, including a budget-stretcher named Leg of Lamb for Eight People Four Times!) Writing with a light and easy style that belies his gusto for food and for life, Father Capon has produced a wholly delightful book that is filled with the wisdom of a man in harmony with himself and his world. Robert Farrar Capon was educated at Columbia University and Seabury-Western Theological Seminary. An Episcopal parish priest in Port Jefferson, New York, he is also Dean, Professor of Dogmatic Theology and Instructor in Greek at The George Mercer Jr. memorial School of Theology in Garden City, New York. Father Capon&#39;s special prayer: &#34;O, Lord, refresh our sensibilities. Give us this day our daily taste. Restore to us soups that spoons will not sink in, and sauces which are never the same twice. Raise up among us stews with more gravy than we have bread to blot it with, and casseroles that put starch and substance in our limp modernity. Take away our fear of fat, and make us glad of the oil which ran upon Aaron&#39;s beard. Give us pasta with a hundred fillings, and rice in a thousand variations. Above all, give us grace to live as true men - to fast till we come to a refreshed sense of what we have and then to dine gratefully on all that comes to hand. Drive far from us, O Most Bountiful, all creatures of air and darkness; cast out the demons that possess us; deliver us from the fear of calories and the bondage of nutrition; and set us free once more in our own land, where we shall serve thee as thou has blessed us - with the dew of heaven, the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine.

Now following his World Fantasy Award winner, <i>Soldier of Sidon</i>, and his stunning <i>Pirate Freedom</i>, Wolfe turns to the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft and the weird science&nbsp;tale of supernatural horror.<br><br>Set a hundred years in the future, <i>An Evil Guest</i> is a story of an actress who becomes the lover of both a mysterious sorcerer and private detective, and an even more mysterious and powerful&nbsp;rich man, who has been to the human colony on an alien planet and learned strange things there. Her loyalties are divided--perhaps she loves them both. The detective helps her to release her inner beauty and become a star overnight. And the rich man is the&nbsp;benefactor of a play she stars in. But something is very wrong. Money can be an evil guest, but there are other evils. As Lovecraft said, "That is not dead which can eternal lie."</p><p>GENE WOLFE&nbsp;is winner of the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, and many other awards.&nbsp; In 2007, he was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. He lives in Barrington, Illinois.&nbsp;Chapter One <p></p>Washington <p></p>They sat at ease in the Oval Office. Had the president looked at his guest, he would have seen a handsome, ageless man, dark-haired, with a smooth oval face and a flawless olive complexion. Had he looked into this man's eyes, he would have seen the night looking out through a mask; it was because he had looked there once-and had not liked what he had seen-that he did not look again. <p></p>Had the president's guest looked at him, he would have seen a lean and hard-faced man of sixty-three who might have been a farmer or a county agent. <p></p>In point of fact, the president had been a rodeo rider whole decades ago. He still looked the part. Like all the best politicians, he looked like anything but a politician. <p></p>"They git you his picture?" the president asked. <p></p>His guest shook his head; on Earth, this guest was known as Gideon Chase. "Well, I'm glad." For a moment, the president's hard blue eyes glinted. "I got a bunch, an' I want to git 'em out of my desk. Give 'em to the FBI when you're through." <p></p>Gideon picked up the first and glanced at it. "Perfec'ly ordinary, ain't he, Dr. Chase?" <p></p>"There are no ordinary men, although so many believe themselves so." <p></p>"You're right, he ain't. He's ordinary lookin' is what I mean." <p></p>Gideon shook his head and tapped the figure in the photograph with a fingernail, at which the figure said, "Woldercan's a beautiful place, one I'm sure I'll miss often. But right now retirement looks awfully good to me and I'm heading for the South Seas." <p></p>"A perfec'ly ordinary-lookin' man, but if I was asked to name one evil man in our entire nation, an' if the fate of the whole damned U.S.A. was ridin' on my answer-well, sir, I'd name him." <p></p>The president waited for Gideon to speak, but Gideon did not. <p></p>"Brought up in the buildin' trade. His pa was a contractor. Become a contractor hisself, an' was smart enough to see the big money went to them that had friends in high places. You want to bellyache about it? I have, more'n once. Don't do any good." "There is no good," Gideon murmured. His voice was level, expressionless. <p></p>The president raised an eyebrow. "I know you made a reputation writin' that shit. You really believe it?" <p></p>"My belief or disbelief will not change the truth," Gideon murmured. <p></p>The president grinned. " 'What's truth?' said jestin' Pilate." <p></p>"That there is no good." <p></p>"Well, sir . . . what about evil?" <p></p>"It does not exist." <p></p>"Well now, I'd call that hombre whose picture you're lookin' at evil. If there's a evil man in the world, he's the one." <p></p>Gideon, who was not in fact looking at any of the pictures, said, "There are none." The president smiled again. "I wish I could believe it. It'd be comfortin'. Only I s'pose I'd have to give up good, too. " <p></p>"No. May I explain? You can't have a great deal of time." <p></p>"For this? I'll take as much time as I think will do any good, an' let the bastards go hang. Explain." <p></p>"Briefly, then. Today, most people think evil the mere absence of good. Darkness-which many confuse with evil-is the mere absence of visible light, after all, just as silence is the absence of audible sound. If these people were correct, there would be no evil, only a lack of good. They are wrong, and when they discover they are wrong, they leap to the opposite error. " <p></p>"Mine, " the president said. <p></p>"Yes. Would you say that evil is synonymous with cruelty? With greed?" <p></p>The president nodded. "I sure would." <p></p>"Then you cannot be correct. Cruelty and greed are very different things. Cruelty is delight in the pain of others. Greed is an insatiable desire to possess. You do not like the result of either one-unless the greed and cruelty are your own. You avenge yourself upon them by calling them evil. There is no difference in kind between your position and that of a woman who shouts "bad dog" when the puppy soils the carpet. The difference is in degree. Only." <p></p>The president pressed a button on his desk. "I think we'd best git down to business." <p></p>Gideon nodded. "So do I." <p></p>"I talked to you the way I did, 'cause I wasn't sure you was the right man for this job. You are. A wizard's what people call you, an' if anybody's qualified for this, you're the one." <p></p>Gideon rarely smiled and did not smile now, though there may have been a gleam of humor in his disturbingly dark eyes. "The only evil man meets the only qualified man, " he whispered. "Not really-come in, John! I said if there was only one evil man in the whole world, it'd have to be Bill Reis. There's a hell of a lot of evil men in the world." <p></p>"Three in particular," the man the president called John added. <p></p>"We haven't gotten to that yet, John, an' I don't think we will." The president motioned toward a chair. "Sit down." <p></p>"My error, Mr. President. I didn't know you were excluding the Senate." John was forty plus, and starting to get fat. The thick, round lenses of his glasses gave the impression of blindness. <p></p>"Explain our problem," the president told him. "Our problem with Bill Reis." <p></p>"Sure. Do you know who he is, Dr. Chase? That will save some time." <p></p>Gideon shook his head. <p></p>"He was a major contributor to President Ingstrup's first campaign. Also to his second, though that doesn't really come into it. Major contributors are often given ambassadorships. Perhaps you're aware of that." <p></p>"My father was an ambassador," Gideon remarked. "He was the U.S. ambassador to the only intelligent nonhumans known to science. . . ." He paused. "To the Wolders," John said. <p></p>"There were older sciences," Gideon murmured, "to which other intelligent races were known. So I've heard. But, yes. He was ambassador to Woldercan, as you say. I was born there. No doubt you know." <p></p>"We do. That was one of the reasons I suggested the president consult you. It wasn't the chief reason but it figured in our thinking." <p></p>"Perhaps you might like to tell me the chief reason." Gideon swept the remaining pictures toward him as he spoke. <p></p>"Your reputation. You specialize in solving problems every other expert declares are impossible or outside his area. You're expensive, we realize-" <p></p>"Not as expensive as government." Gideon was looking at the pictures as he spoke, glancing at each in turn, then laying it facedown on the president's desk, his hands sure and swift. <p></p>John laughed. "You've got us there. Of course not. But expensive. You'd have the entire cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation." <p></p>"You can commit them?" <p></p>"Yes. You would be an adjunct to our investigation." <p></p>"How flattering." Gideon's gleam returned. "If I were to-" <p></p>The president interrupted. "Your dad was a patriot. I didn't know him personally, but I've talked to some that did. He served this country ably as a private citizen an' a diplomat. None of the people I talked to said you were much like him, but I've found out that every man in the world gits certain traits from his folks. As I told John, your not resemblin' your father on the surface tells me you'll be like him down deeper." <p></p>Nodding, Gideon swept the photographs into a neat stack and pushed the stack away. <p></p>"We can't give you a lot of money," John said, "but we have other ways of rewarding people who help us. You would be recommended to friends of the president's who might make use of you. If you'd enjoy a professorship at one of our leading universities . . ." <p></p>"I'd like to know what this man Reis has done," Gideon murmured. "Well, think it over, Dr. Chase. You have a Ph.D., don't you? Some private college in Massachusetts?" <p></p>Gideon nodded. <p></p>"There you are. It would be easy. A professorship at Harvard or Princeton could be readily arranged. It would involve very little actual work and would convey a great deal of prestige." <p></p>"What has Reis done?" Gideon spoke to the president, not to John. <p></p>"He's a spy," the president said, "an' that's just for starters. We can't nab him 'cause we got no evidence. But he travels around. He stops at sensitive spots. He don't stay long, but soon afterward our sources in-well, never you mind. In a certain foreign country, okay? They tell us certain people there have got holt of somethin' we were tryin' to hold close to our vests." Gideon shrugged. "Have him killed." <p></p>"Not 'til we find out how he does it." <p></p>John said, "He's found a .aw in a security system we thought just about flawless-not something he can exploit now and then, but something he can exploit whenever he chooses. We've got to know what it is." <p></p>"That he can exploit," Gideon murmured, "only when he is in close proximity to the facility in which your secret operations are being carried out." "He's a blackmailer, too," the president said. "We know that." "For money?" Gideon's gaze roved the room. <p></p>"Sometimes." John cleared his throat. "More often for other things. Sexual favors, at times. Introductions and information." <p></p>Gideon said, "You will have considered that he may be blackmailing someone at each of the industrial plants and laboratories he visits. They are plants or laboratories? Most of them? May I assume that?" <p></p>"He would have to meet with them, or telephone them at least," John said. Gideon looked amused. "E-mail them? Write letters? What about carrier pigeons?" <p></p>The president's hand came down on his desk with a resounding smack. "This ain't .t for humor." <p></p>"Then you shouldn't tempt me to it. Neither of you should, and both of you have." Gideon leaned back in his chair. "You'll be listening in on telephone calls. Data mining? Isn't that what you call it? You'd pick it up. You're certainly tapping the lines of those laboratories or whatever, as well as the telephones of everyone privy to sensitive information. If you prattle about cell phones now, I shall go home. I'm beginning to miss my little apartments already." <p></p>John murmured, "Just assume that we're already doing everything every ordinary person would think of. Because we are. Assume, too...</p><h2>Pages from the Goncourt Journal</h2><p>The diary of the two de Goncourt brothers who were novelists, critics and dilettanti of Parisian literary and fashionable circles during the second half of the 19th century.

In three previous novels, Jason Goodwin has taken us on stylish, suspenseful, and vibrant excursions into its exotic territory. Now, in <i>An Evil Eye</i>, the mystery of Istanbul runs deeper than ever before.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s 1839, and the admiral of the Ottoman fleet has defected to the Egyptians. It&#x2019;s up to the intrepid Investigator Yashim to uncover the man&#x2019;s motives. Of course, Fevzi Ahmet is no stranger to Yashim&#x2014;it was Fevzi who taught the investigator his craft years ago. He&#x2019;s the only man whom Yashim has ever truly feared: ruthless, cruel, and unswervingly loyal to the sultan. So what could have led Yashim&#x2019;s former mentor to betray the Ottoman Empire?&nbsp;Yashim&#x2019;s search draws him into the sultan&#x2019;s seraglio, a well-appointed world with an undercurrent of fear, ambition, and deep-seated superstition. When the women of the sultan&#x2019;s orchestra begin inexplicably to grow ill and die, Yashim discovers that the admiral&#x2019;s defection may be rooted somewhere in the torturous strictures of the sultan&#x2019;s harem.&nbsp;No one knows more about the Ottoman Empire and Istanbul than Jason Goodwin, of whom Janet<br>Maslin wrote in <i>The New York Times</i>: &#x201c;Mr. Goodwin uses rich historical detail to elevate the books in this series . . . far above the realm of everyday sleuthing.&#x201d;</p><p>Jason Goodwin is the bestselling author of <i>The Janissary Tree</i>, <i>The Snake Stone</i>, and <i>The Bellini Card</i>, the first three books in his series of novels featuring Yashim.

Beams settle; boards contract. Cracks ease around the window frames, whose latticed glass flames orange with the setting sun.</i><i>The pasha&#x2019;s two-oared ca�que skims like a cormorant up the Bosphorus toward it, away from Istanbul.</i><i>He leans into the cushions, his back to the setting sun, and lets his mind rove idly across the water, over the surface of his ambitions and his desires.</i><i>He checks himself. He is not a superstitious man, but praise and pride attract the evil eye; certain thoughts are better left unframed.</i><i>Almost guiltily, he turns his head. The</i> yali <i>stands so beautifully at the water&#x2019;s edge, looking out across the Bosphorus to the hills of Asia beyond. The evening meal has been taken, and he imagines the murmur of voices as his household prepares for sleep. He can almost hear the</i> yali <i>settling, its old bones composing themselves for the night, wooden joints creaking and crackling in the dusk.</i><i>He turns his head&#x2014;and puts out a hand, as if it were in his power to stop what is about to happen. As if he could fit the house in his own palm, and keep it safe.</i><i>Between his outstretched fingers, the</i> yali <i>is ablaze.</i><i>It burns so beautifully, as if a wild spirit were dashing through the rooms. A window explodes, and against the evening sky the sparks fly up like shooting stars. Galaxies twist from the staircase; suns blaze in every room.</i><i>The pasha screams. The rowers glance back. They miss a stroke.</i><i>Over the crash of falling timber and the snapping of the flames, the pasha hears screams from the harem apartments, upstairs.</i><i>When the ca�que touches the marble stairs, the pasha flings himself onto shore. His mouth is open, sweat rolling down his face.</i><i>He races from one end of the burning house to the other, moaning. He feels the heat on his face. He can no longer hear the screams.</i><i>But he hears, instead, someone call his name.</i><i>&#x201c;Fevzi Pasha! Pasha!&#x201d;</i><i>Two arms thrust a bundle from a window. The pasha reaches up.</i><i>The roof sags, dropping a sudden flurry of flaming shingles, which spin to the ground. The pasha leaps back. The figure at the window is gone. The window is gone.</i><i>The flames are driving a firestorm: the pasha feels the wind snatch at his cloak, drawing him back toward the</i> yali<i>.</i><i>He cradles the bundle to his chest and stumbles away.</i><i>The gate bursts open, and a crowd of men surges in with buckets, hooks, ladders. But it is far too late. As the men run by, the pasha hears timbers break and the sky is lit up.</i><i>He does not turn back.</i><i>1</i>CANNON boomed across the Bosphorus. White smoke, the color of mourning, billowed low over the water.Sultan Mahmut II was dead. He had come to the throne of Osman as the turbaned ruler of a medieval empire, and had died in a frock coat and a fez. In his long reign he had given the Ottoman Empire French saddles, a constitution of sorts, modern drill and percussion rifles. He had destroyed the ferocious Janissaries, as an obstacle to progress, and he had lost Greece to the Greeks and Crimea to the Russians and Egypt to an Albanian adventurer called Mehmet Ali Pasha. He had built himself a modern palace, at Besiktas, where he maintained a harem like sultans of old.The harem was in pandemonium.&#x201c;You are the Kislar aga, Ibou. You must help them to leave,&#x201d; Yashim said quietly. &#x201c;The sultan&#x2019;s harem is your domain. The sultan has died, and the women must move on.&#x201d;The Kislar aga, the master of the girls, shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against his smooth cheeks. &#x201c;They&#x2014;they do not want to go, Yashim.&#x201d;&#x201c;Abd�lmecid is sultan now. Any moment he may arrive here, at Besiktas, and he will bring his women.&#x201d; Yashim gestured to the staircase.The Kislar aga took a deep breath and started up the stairs. &#x201c;You must come with me. We must get the women away.&#x201d;Yashim followed reluctantly as the Kislar aga bustled through the gallery, clapping his hands. &#x201c;The carriages are come, ladies! To the carriages!&#x201d;Not one of the women paid him the slightest attention. They had spent years learning how to behave, how to speak, how to be beautiful, devoting their lives to the service of the sultan. Now the sultan was dead and carriages were to take them away.They wanted to wail and scream, and to mourn.To mourn the sultan, their youth, their hopes.And grab what they could, while there was still time.Copyright � 2011 by Jason Goodwin</p><h2>The Grassfed Gourmet Cookbook: Healthy Cooking &amp; Good Living with Pasture Raised Foods</h2><p>In the emerald-green fields of America&#39;�?s finest pasture-based farms, cattle, pigs, bison, goats, sheep, and poultry roam free, eating what nature intended them to eat.

And the man who would sire the King of the Britons.<br><br>From the trials of boyhood to the new cloak of adult responsibility, we see Uther with fresh eyes. He will travel the length of the land, have adventures, and, through fate or tragedy, fall in love with the one woman he must not have. Uther is a compelling love story and, like the other books in the Camulod Chronicles, a version of the legend that is more realistic than anything that has been available to readers before.<br></p><p>The seventh book in Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles, <i>Uther</i> is a parallel novel to <i>The Eagle's Brood</i>. It fills in some gaps about another major character in the Arthurian legend, Uther Pendragon, who is Merlyn's cousin and King Arthur's father.<p> <i>Uther</i> tells the tale of a young man torn between his love for his adopted Camulod and for the land of his birth, Cambria. Born to be one of the seven Chiefs of the Pendragon federation of Cambria, with the possibility of becoming its king one day, Uther goes from being a carefree boy to a seasoned leader of his people who must wage war to protect his land. Along the way, Uther loses his friendship with Merlyn and falls in love with the wife of his enemy, thereby forging a union that will lead to the birth of Arthur, King of the Britons.</p><p> Once again Whyte weaves a tale of intrigue, betrayal, love, and war in a gritty and realistic tale that continues to explore the legend of Camelot. With <i>Uther</i>, Whyte is at his best--he takes his time telling the story and allows his main characters to be both flawed and heroic. Fans of the Camulod Chronicles will be familiar with the inevitable ending of this book, but <i>Uther</i> is a worthwhile addition to the series. For those new to the series, <i>Uther</i> can stand alone as an entry to the story, but it might be best to start with <i>The Skystone</i>, where Whyte's tale truly begins. <i>--Kathie Huddleston</i></p>"A series that promises to provide historic plausibility to the legend of King Arthur...the best of its type in the near quarter of a century since Mary Stewart's version of these legends burst upon the publishing scene."--"The Chattanooga Times" <br>With "Uther," Jack Whyte, author of the richly praised Camulod Chronicles, has given us a portrait of Uther Pendragon, Merlyn's shadow--his boyhood companion and closest friend.

According to the aesthetic principles long prevailing in Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan, even two rocks arranged in a tiny, enclosed space can be considered a garden. This type of garden is called a tsuboniwa, and Kyoto has long being considered its birthplace and home. So it is not surprising that photographer Katsuhiko Mizuno, wishing to capture the best of such small gardens, should turn to Kyoto and its palaces, temples, shrines, and town houses.<br><br>The highlight of the book is the 100 photographs of these tsuboniwa-snow overlying sand patterns; coloring maple leaves; flowering cherry trees; lanterns, basins, fences; gardens featuring wisteria, azalea, hydrangea, Indian lilac, camellia, and daphne. Each photo is accompanied by an insightful caption pointing out the outstanding characteristics of the garden in question.<br><br>An appendix gives Mizuno's instructions for creating a tsuboniwa, based on his personal experience.

For 20 years predating her controversial representation of the younger Menendez brother, Abramson worked on behalf of accused baby-killers, bank robbers, and hit men, both in private practice and for the public defender's office in L.A. More than a collection of war stories, this book shows how the attitudes and tactics evident in the Menendez defense informed Abramson's work from the beginning. Her willingness to withhold judgment, to become immersed in the life of her client, and to argue like hell--not necessarily for exoneration but for a ``fair verdict''--are trademark Abramson strengths. Writing (with the aid of New York Times editor Flaste) in the frank, street-smart style familiar to those who watched her TV commentary during the Simpson trial, Abramson shows how she's been staring down bullies since her turbulent childhood in Queens, NY. Seven years as a public defender exposed her to an ``astonishing number . . . of remarkably stupid, totally crazy or deplorably lazy'' judges whom she charmed and dominated (``No one had to tell me how to take over a courtroom''). In 1981, four years into her private practice, she represented one of the killers in the Bob's Big Boy massacre, that year's ``crime of the century.'' Despite her ferocious defense, she lost the case--``all the way to the death penalty.'' But from then on she was on the shortlist for high-profile capital cases. Abramson clearly relishes describing her courtroom tactics and behind-the-scenes maneuvers, so it is disappointing that she confines her commentary on the Menendez trial to a summary of the facts of that case, a few choice words for Judge Stanley Weisberg, and a plea to ``pull the plug'' on cameras in the courtroom. Despite the surprisingly short shrift given to the Menendez trial, a terrific introduction to criminal defense by a master practitioner.

All rights reserved.</i>Crafty counselor that she is, Abramson mentions in the first sentence of this outspoken, self-promoting memoir her greatest claim to fame: she was a defense attorney for one of the Menendez brothers. The shadow of that case stretches over Abramson's entire narrative, even over her childhood memories of growing up Jewish in 1950s Queens, N.Y.: "I can see now how children come to love their mothers automatically. It must take an almost unimaginable degree of pain to ever make a child not love a mother." The book opens with a case Abramson handled between the two Menendez trials. A bouncer emptied 15 rounds into three men, killing two; with Abramson's help, he walked. With this case, Abramson introduces the idea of preemptive self-defense, offering legal insights that are sharp and knowing. When she finally gets to the Menendez case, however, Abramson fails to address adequately several key questions: Why didn't the boys just leave? Why did Lyle finish off his mother with that second gruesome shotgun blast? Why was Abramson pulled from Lyle's defense for the second trial? A conversational style and colorful case histories provide some balance to Abramson's manipulative account of the trial-but not enough, particularly given the accompanying ax-grinding and score-settling. Menendez buffs will want to buy this, but most armchair lawyers will find more edifying fare in the books of Gerry Spence or, looking backward, of Louis Nizer.

Hundreds of Internet websites, magazines, newsletters, even entire publishing houses, disseminate information on invisible enemies and their secret activities, subversions, and coverups. Those who suspect conspiracies behind events in the news--the crash of TWA Flight 800, the death of Marilyn Monroe--join generations of Americans, from the colonial period to the present day, who have entertained visions of vast plots. In this enthralling book Robert Goldberg focuses on five major conspiracy theories of the past half-century, examining how they became widely popular in the United States and why they have remained so. In the post&#x2013;World War II decades conspiracy theories have become more numerous, more commonly believed, and more deeply embedded in our culture, Goldberg contends. He investigates conspiracy theories regarding the Roswell UFO incident, the Communist threat, the rise of the Antichrist, the assassination of President John Kennedy, and the Jewish plot against black America, in each case taking historical, social, and political environments into account. Conspiracy theories are not merely the products of a lunatic fringe, the author shows. Rather, paranoid rhetoric and thinking are disturbingly central in America today. With media validation and dissemination of conspiracy ideas, and federal government behavior that damages public confidence and faith, the ground is fertile for conspiracy thinking.</p><p>In this enthralling book Robert Goldberg focuses on conspiracy theories in post-World War II America, examining how they became popular and why they remain so.

Like all great comic strips, it provides a much-needed daily dose of comedy and, most importantly, keeps its finger firmly planted on the pulse of truth while doing so." Some might think that the corporate scandals of 2002 could make it difficult to find anything funny about today's business world. But <i>When Body Language Goes Bad</i> proves it will take more than that to slow down the inventive wit of Scott Adams, who clearly is never at a loss for finding hysterical things to mock in corporate life.<br>This marks the 21st collection of Adams' wildly popular comic strip, D<i>ilbert, </i>which is featured in more than 2,000 newspapers worldwide. This book updates loyal readers on the so-called careers of Dilbert, Alice, Wally, Asok the intern, and other regulars as they wallow through pointless projects, mismanaged company takeovers, futile team-building exercises, and other inane company initiatives like the "name the rest room" contest.<br><br>In addition to the strips' familiar characters, this collection showcases Adams' masterful ability to create hilarious "guest stars." There's the network design engineer known as Psycho Hillbilly, who was going for the gentle biker look until he decided it was overdone. Then, there's M. T. Suit, who is merely an empty suit walking the office halls spewing corporatese, such as "promising to enhance core competencies by leveraging platforms."<br><br>Adams says that about 80 percent of his initial ideas come from his 150 million-plus readers.

But the origins of this masterpiece are far from what one might expect, and its beginnings lie in murder, deceit, bitter political feuds, and religious conflicts so intense they threatened the unity of England. The struggle to translate the Bible into English was a passionate cause, in the name of which crusaders fought, were imprisoned, and were sometimes even executed_like William Tyndale, whose efforts to translate the New Testament into English led him to a gruesome death. Now, Alister McGrath explores the origins of this monumental work and delves into the forces that brought it into being, illuminating a particularly volatile and culturally rich period in European history.<br><br>When Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in the 1450s, he was setting into motion an intellectual and cultural revolution that would have implications far beyond the literary world. The first book printed on this remarkable invention was the most important book in Christendom, the Bible, which was published in its Latin translation. Until Gutenberg, ordinary Christians had to go through an elite clergy to get access to the Scriptures that were the foundation of their faith.<br><br>But this watershed event lit the spark of the Protestant Refomation, whose advocates ultimately demanded, among other things, that the Scriptures be translated into the vernacular languages of the people so that they might experience the Word of God for themselves. <br><br>Named for the Scottish king who ascended the English throne in 1603, the King James Bible wouldn't be published until 1611, and it was not, in fact, the first Bible to be published in English; but its impact has been profound. Its language has been an inspiration for virtually every great writer since the seventeenth century, and has also provided the style and vocabulary for such different forms of expression as Negro spirituals and the Gettysburg address. <br><br>For the lover of history, literature, or language, <b>In the Beginning</b> is a book that shouldn't be missed. In bringing the story of the King James Bible to light, it captures a vanished period of history in vivid, compelling detail, and will more than prove Roberth Lowth's famous assertion that the King James translation is the "noblest monument of English prose."<br><br></p><p><i>In the Beginning</i> is Alister McGrath's history of the King James Bible, and as the subtitle explains, his explanation of "How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture." McGrath's story begins with the development of the printing press, describes the forces (before, during, and after the Reformation) fueling the demand for English vernacular translations of the Bible, and considers the impact of the King James Version on Western worship and politics. McGrath deftly blends an arch and charming, donnish argot with breezy, tough, brass-tacks directness. Of the ongoing process of creating new biblical translations, he writes, "It has yet to end; indeed, it will not end, until either history is brought to a close or English ceases to be a living language." Elsewhere, describing the cultural influence of the Authorized Version, he explains, "Without the King James Bible, there would have been no <i>Paradise Lost</i>, no <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, no Handel's <i>Messiah</i>, no Negro spirituals, and no Gettysburg address.") A professor of historical theology at the University of Oxford, McGrath has written a number of popular books about Christianity (including <i>Theology for Amateurs</i>). <i>In The Beginning</i> continues his work of making complex matters of theological thought and history accessible to a wider audience. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Alister McGrath has the teacher's gift for focusing on memorable details which illustrate wider issues. The book is spattered with brilliant little vignettes."&#x2014;Dom. Henry Wansbrough, St. Benet's Hall, Oxford University<br><br>"Doubleday and McGrath are to be congratulated for producing such a fascinating and informative story of the translation of the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. Personally I encountered some new details I had not found in any other work on this subject. McGrath skillfully and interestingly constructs the historical, political, economic, social, and religious background the tenor of the times that provided the impetus for this version. Certainly all modern Bible translators (including this one) owe a tremendous debt to the KJV and its translators. I enthusiastically recommend this book."&#x2014;Kenneth L. Barker, executive director, NIV Translation Center, International Bible Society (retired) <br><br>"Alister McGrath is to be congratulated on writing a fascinating and splendid volume about an even more splendid and fascinating book, the famous King James Version of the Bible.

Human rights. Freedom of thought and expression. Belief in reason and progress. The value of scientific inquiry. These are just some of the ideas that were conceived and developed during the Enlightenment, and which changed forever the intellectual landscape of the Western world. Spanning hundreds of years of history, Anthony Pagden traces the origins of this seminal movement, showing how Enlightenment concepts directly influenced modern culture, making possible a secular, tolerant, and, above all, cosmopolitan world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone can agree on its impact. But in the end, just what was Enlightenment? A cohesive philosophical project? A discrete time period in the life of the mind when the superstitions of the past were overthrown and reason and equality came to the fore? Or an open-ended intellectual process, a way of looking at the world and the human condition, that continued long after the eighteenth century ended? To address these questions, Pagden introduces us to some of the unforgettable characters who defined the Enlightenment, including David Hume, the Scottish skeptic who advanced the idea of a universal &#x201c;science of man&#x201d;; Fran�ois-Marie Arouet, better known to the world as Voltaire, the acerbic novelist and social critic who challenged the authority of the Catholic Church; and Immanuel Kant, the reclusive German philosopher for whom the triumph of a cosmopolitan world represented the final stage in mankind&#x2019;s evolution. Comprehensive in his analysis of this heterogeneous group of scholars and their lasting impact on the world, Pagden argues that Enlightenment ideas go beyond the &#x201c;empire of reason&#x201d; to involve the full recognition of the emotional ties that bind all human beings together. The &#x201c;human science&#x201d; developed by these eminent thinkers led to a universalizing vision of humanity, a bid to dissolve the barriers past generations had attempted to erect between the different cultures of the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> A clear and compelling explanation of the philosophical underpinnings of the modern world, <i>The Enlightenment</i> is a scintillating portrait of a period, a critical moment in history, and a revolution in thought that continues to this day.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Enlightenment</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Sweeping . . .

By the light of a candle, shaded so as not to reveal his whereabouts while the forces of the French Revolution closed in on him, he wrote a brief fragment of what was intended to be a much longer work, the Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind. Condorcet was one of the great mathematicians of his or any other age, one of the creators of differential calculus, and the first person to attempt to predict the possible outcome of human decision-making by using mathematics, which makes him the forefather of modern political science. He was also a champion of equal rights for women and for all peoples of all races and an abolitionist who devised the world&#x2019;s first state education system. Like all men of his class in the eighteenth century, he was deeply involved in politics.1 He had been an active supporter of the Revolution in its early stages, becoming the Paris representative of the National Assembly in 1791 and then its secretary. Although a member of the Girodins, the more moderate of the two revolutionary parties, he continued until his death to see the Revolution as a force that had accelerated the normal course of history, and he looked upon the French constitution, as did its authors, as not merely a constitution for a new republican France but a constitution for humankind.2 When, in December 1792, the National Assembly put the king, Louis XVI, on trial as a traitor, Condorcet supported the move, believing, like the Anglo-American radical Tom Paine&#x2014;now a naturalized French citizen&#x2014;that it would show the world that kings, too, could be held accountable for their crimes. But because, like all good liberals&#x2014;like Paine, indeed&#x2014;he rejected the idea that the state had the right to take human life, he passionately opposed the idea of his execution. This did not win him friends among the revolutionary hard-liners, and when in 1793 he voted against the new constitution proposed by the Jacobins, he was branded as a traitor and an enemy of the Revolution. A warrant for his arrest was issued on July 8, after which he went into hiding in the rue Servandoni. On March 25, 1794, sensing that the forces of the Terror were closing in on him and fearful that his continuing presence might prove dangerous to the good Madame Vernet, he fled Paris, taking with him only a volume of the poems of Horace. He seems to have spent the night of the 26th in the countryside around Clamart, some nine kilometers outside Paris, and on the 27th, exhausted, famished, and apparently wounded in one leg, he stopped at an inn and ordered an omelette. The innkeeper asked him how many eggs he wanted. &#x201c;Twelve,&#x201d; replied Condorcet. He was immediately arrested and taken to Bourg-la Reine to await prosecution by the dreaded Revolutionary Tribunal. (Only aristocrats ever ate so many eggs at one sitting.)3 Two days later, on March 29, 1794, he died in prison, under somewhat mysterious circumstances, the victim of what the conservative Anglo-Irish orator, philosopher, and political theorist Edmund Burke nicely called &#x201c;the delusive plausibilities of moral politicians.&#x201d;4<br><br>Condorcet was one of the most prominent, distinguished, and widely loved victims of the revolutionary fury, yet for the enemies of the Enlightenment, on both the extreme left and the far right, he became one of the worst exponents of the confidence in human rationality that had supposedly made the Revolution possible. &#x201c;That philosophe so dear to the Revolution,&#x201d; the arch-conservative Joseph de Maistre said of him, &#x201c;who used his life to prepare the unhappiness of the present generation, graciously willing perfection to posterity.&#x201d;5 Maximilien de Robespierre, the sanguineous theoretician of the Terror, thought no better of him. &#x201c;A great geometrician,&#x201d; he called him after his death, &#x201c;or so say the men of letters; a great man of letters in the opinion of the geometricians, and later a timid conspirator despised by all parties.&#x201d;6<br><br>Much of this hostility, and De Maistre&#x2019;s in particular, was not directed at Condorcet&#x2019;s mathematical writings, although his vision of a life regulated by the certainty of predication struck some&#x2014;as it did the Romantic literary critic Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve&#x2014;as a recipe for &#x201c;universal mediocrity,&#x201d; in which there would be no place &#x201c;for great virtues, for acts of heroism,&#x201d; a bright new world whose unfortunate citizens would all die of boredom. It was directed instead at the Sketch, which was his most accessible and would become his best-known work.7<br><br>As its somewhat provisional title makes clear, the Sketch is a universal history of mankind, divided into ten &#x201c;epochs.&#x201d; It starts in prehistory with small wandering bands whose condition can only be inferred by &#x201c;examining the intellectual and moral faculties and the physical constitution of man.&#x201d; It then takes the reader through the successive stages of human social evolution until it arrives at the current condition of the &#x201c;enlightened nations of Europe.&#x201d; The final epoch lies in the future. It is here that all the promises of that period, which, like his contemporaries, Condorcet referred to as the &#x201c;century of light&#x201d; or the &#x201c;century of philosophy&#x201d; and we today call the Enlightenment, &#x201c;would finally be realized.&#x201d; The natural sciences, he argued, which had achieved such astounding successes in the seventeenth century, are based upon one single and unwavering belief: that all the laws of the universe are &#x201c;necessary and constant&#x201d; throughout time. As humans are part of this universe, the study of their history, although it is unlikely to uncover laws as certain as those of physics, will at least allow the historian to &#x201c;predict with great probability the events of the future.&#x201d; What, then, will the future bring? Given the conditions in which he was writing, Condorcet was perhaps being unduly optimistic. But he remained convinced that<br><br>Our hopes for the future state of the human species may be summed up in three important points: the elimination of the inequality between nations; progress in equality within the same peoples; and finally the real perfection of mankind. All peoples should one day approach the state of civilization attained by the most enlightened, the most free, and the most free from prejudices, such as are the French and the Anglo-Americans.<br><br>Today we have grown wary of the word civilization, after the uses to which, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was put. But Condorcet understood it not as some undifferentiated cultural and political state that all peoples should be compelled to adopt but what he called an &#x201c;equal diffusion of enlightenment,&#x201d; a condition in which all mankind would acquire<br><br>the necessary enlightenment to conduct themselves in accordance with their own reason in the common affairs of life, and to maintain them, free of prejudices, so that they might know their rights and be at liberty to exercise them according to their own opinion and their conscience, where all might, through the development of their faculties, obtain the certain means to provide for their needs.<br><br>In 1794 these conditions clearly did not yet exist. But Condorcet assured his readers that the &#x201c;progress which science and civilization&#x201d; had made was such that there was &#x201c;the strongest reasons to believe that nature has set no limit to our hopes.&#x201d; Even now, or so he thought, the principles behind the French constitution were shared by all enlightened beings across the world. Soon they would be shared by all mankind. Soon, what he called the &#x201c;great religions of the Orient&#x201d;&#x2014;by which he meant not only Islam but also, and most especially, Christianity&#x2014;which for so long had kept their cringing adherents trapped in a state of &#x201c;slavery without hope and a perpetual infancy,&#x201d; would finally be revealed for the lies, tricks, and deceits that they were. When that day arrived, &#x201c;The sun will rise only upon a world of free men who will recognize no master other than their own reason, where tyrants and slaves, priests and their stupid or hypocritical instruments, will exist only in history or in the theatre.&#x201d; When that day arrived, as he had told the doubtless skeptical members of the Acad�mie fran�aise twelve years earlier, &#x201c;We will have seen reason emerge victorious from that struggle, so long and so painful, [so] that at last we will be able to write: truth has triumphed; the human race is saved!&#x201d;8<br><br>Some aspects of Condorcet&#x2019;s imaginary future can today sound uncomfortably like a precursor to the objectives of the civilizing missions that would flood so much of the world in the nineteenth century. Yet for all his belief in the goods that the inescapable forward march of western civilization would finally bring, he was also acutely aware of the depredations that that civilization, in its insatiable quest for &#x201c;sugar and spices&#x201d; in Africa, Asia, and America, and &#x201c;our betrayals, our bloody contempt for men of a different color or belief, our insolence and our usurpations&#x201d; had inflicted on &#x201c;those vast lands.&#x201d;9 But he firmly believed that now that the perpetrators themselves had thrown off the kings and priests who had been largely responsible for these horrors, these depredations would soon be only a distant memory, and the peoples of Africa and Asia (alas, it was already too late for the poor American Indians) would be waiting patiently for the day when they might become the &#x201c;friends and disciples&#x201d; of new, enlightened Europeans.<br><br>Condorcet&#x2019;s vision of the future, although challenged and derided, has had and continues to have a powerful hold over the imagination of the western world. It is, although he does not use the term, deeply cosmopolitan. Cosmopolitanism, like so much else in the western philosophical tradition, has been with us since antiquity. Diogenes the Cynic of the fourth century bce, the man famous for living in barrel and walking the streets of Athens at midday with a lighted lamp in search of an &#x201c;honest man,&#x201d; was supposedly the first to declare, when asked from what city (polis) he came: &#x201c;I am a citizen of the world [kosmo-polites].&#x201d;10 Later the expression was taken up by the Stoics, who, as we shall see, were to play a transformative role in its subsequent history. For all the opprobrium directed against it in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when &#x201c;cosmopolitanism&#x201d; came to be cast as a form of immorality, a betrayal of every man&#x2019;s true and proper objects of loyalty, which was not to the world but to the nation, it has shown itself to be remarkably resilient. It has been the inspiration behind the League of Nations and the United Nations, behind the International Court of Justice and the beleaguered, but still enduring, belief in the possibility for a truly international law. Today it provides the theoretical foundations for the modern conceptions of &#x201c;international justice,&#x201d; &#x201c;geo-governance,&#x201d; &#x201c;global civil society,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Constitutional patriotism.&#x201d;11 It has, as the Anglo-Ghanaian philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, himself an exemplary cosmopolitan, rightly says of it, &#x201c;certainly proved a survivor.&#x201d;12<br><br>The version of cosmopolitanism that Condorcet was proposing, like Condorcet himself, was also unmistakably a creature of &#x201c;the Enlightenment.&#x201d; To say that, however, is to beg a number of questions. For just what exactly the Enlightenment was has been the subject of irate and furious debates ever since the eighteenth century itself. No other intellectual movement, no other period in history, has attracted so much disagreement, so much intransigence, so much simple anger. The key terms of almost every modern conflict over how we are to define and understand &#x201c;humanity&#x201d;&#x2014;modernism, postmodernism, universalism, imperialism, multiculturalism&#x2014;ultimately refer back to some understanding of the Enlightenment. No topic of historical debate, none of the great controversies over the turning points in history or over the moment in which &#x201c;modernity&#x201d; is believed to have begun&#x2014;not the Renaissance, nor the Reformation, not the Scientific Revolution nor the Industrial Revolution&#x2014;has exercised anything like the hold that the Enlightenment does over the ideological divisions within the modern world.<br><br>The struggle over the identity of the Enlightenment was also a part of the Enlightenment itself. In December 1783 the Berlinische Monats�schrift, a widely read and generally progressive journal, published an article by a theologian and educational reformer named Johann Friedrich Z�llner. The article was on the desirability of purely civil marriages&#x2014;a somewhat recondite topic. It might have passed unnoticed, and probably unread, if it had not been for a single footnote. &#x201c;What is enlightenment?&#x201d; Z�llner asked. &#x201c;This question, which is almost as important as what is truth, should indeed be answered before one begins enlightening. And still I have never found it answered!&#x201d;13 It was perhaps the most significant footnote in the entire history of western thought&#x2014;it was certainly the most widely discussed. Six years later, shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolution, the German poet and philosopher Christoph Martin Wieland&#x2014;once described as the German Voltaire&#x2014;while seated on the toilet and reaching for what he coyly calls a &#x201c;maculature&#x201d; (in other words, a piece of toilet paper), found, &#x201c;not without a slight shudder of astonishment,&#x201d; that the sheet of &#x201c;good white soft paper&#x201d; he held in his hand had printed on it six questions, the first of which was: &#x201c;What is enlightenment?&#x201d;14<br><br>The debate that Z�llner had inadvertently begun seems to have been a uniquely German event. But the widespread diffusion of the term Enlightenment&#x2014;Aufkl�rung in German, Lumi�res in French, Ilustraci�n in Spanish, Illuminismo in Italian, Oplysning in Danish&#x2014;and the confusion it aroused was by no means confined to the German-speaking lands (there was, as yet, no such place as Germany). In France, in England, in Spain, in Sweden, in Holland, in Italy, in Portugal people had been asking themselves similar questions since at least the middle of the century. Despite this, however, the answer was very far from being, as Wieland breezily claimed, &#x201c;known to everyone.&#x201d; Condorcet himself, who was not beset by the intellectual anxiety that has afflicted modern historians, described it as a &#x201c;disposition of minds.&#x201d; The Germans called it a Denkart, a frame of mind, and the French a mentalit�, a view on the world. The great Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn took it to be the theoretical part of education (culture being the &#x201c;objective&#x201d; part).15 For the sometime Jesuit novice and Freemason Karl Leonhard Reinhold, it was the process of &#x201c;making . . . rational men out of men who are capable of rationality.&#x201d;16 For the Prussian jurist Ernst Ferdinand Klein it meant, rather more prosaically, the freedom of the press (something he seems to imagine, wistfully, that the Prussian king Frederick the Great had endorsed). For the radical and theologian Carl Friedrich Bahrdt it meant the &#x201c;holiest, most important, most inviolable right of man,&#x201d; to &#x201c;think for oneself.&#x201d;17 It was a &#x201c;pure insight,&#x201d; in the words of the nineteenth-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, that seeped into men&#x2019;s thoughts like a &#x201c;perfume&#x201d; or&#x2014;since Hegel was at best uncertain about its benefits&#x2014;an &#x201c;infection.&#x201d;18 It may well be true, as the twentieth-century German philosopher (and author of what is still one of the most powerfully persuasive accounts of the Enlightenment) Ernst Cassirer said in 1932, that &#x201c;the real philosophy of the Enlightenment is not simply the sum total of what its leading thinkers . . . [t]hought and taught,&#x201d; but a process, the &#x201c;pulsation of the inner intellectual life,&#x201d; that consisted &#x201c;less in the certain individual doctrines than in the form and manner o...</p><h2>Arts&amp;Crafts (Architecture&amp;Design Library)</h2><p>A Stunning photographic survey of Arts&amp;Crafts style houses, furniture, lamps, textiles and more.</p><p></p><h2>Get Carter (Allison &amp; Busby Classics)</h2><p>Jack Carter has come back to Doncaster for his brother Frank&#39;s funeral.

A Long Walk to Water begins as two stories, told in alternating sections, about a girl in Sudan in 2008 and a boy in Sudan in 1985. The girl, Nya, is fetching water from a pond that is two hours&#39; walk from her home: she makes two trips to the pond every day. The boy, Salva, becomes one of the &#34;&#34;lost boys&#34;&#34; of Sudan, refugees who cover the African continent on foot as they search for their families and for a safe place to stay. Enduring every hardship from loneliness to attack by armed rebels to contact with killer lions and crocodiles, Salva is a survivor, and his story goes on to intersect with Nya&#39;s in an astonishing and moving way.</p><p>"Meeting Salva was one of the best things that has ever happened to me. His story is both horrifying and uplifting, a testament to the strength of the human spirit against the worst adversities, and the generousity in people's hearts when we're at our best.

Devastation, loneliness, and bitterness are some emotions that exist due to a breakup, divorce, or the loss of a loved one. But with the help of this compassionate guide, Dr. John Gray expresses that you will survive and tells you how to find love again.</p><p>While the process of healing is similar with both sexes, there are distinct differences between the ways men and women heal their bruised hearts. In <em>Mars and Venus Starting Over</em>, Dr. Gray offers gender-specific advice on how to:</p><ul><li>Deal with pain</li><li>Find forgiveness</li><li>Discover the strength to let go</li><li>Rebuild confidence</li><li>Rise to the challenge of finding fulfillment again</li></ul><p>Filled with gentle guidance, healing practices, and compassionate wisdom, <em>Mars and Venus Starting Over</em> will help men and women explore the meaning of loss, find their way through the healing process, and discover the secret to moving on.</p></p><p>A breakup, divorce, or loss of a loved one isn't just the end of your relationship with that person. It's a continuation of every feeling of abandonment you've ever suffered. It's the loss of a system of approval you'd come to depend on. The struggle, as Gray points out in <i>Starting Over</i>, isn't just to find a new partner, but to get over those feelings of abandonment or loss or anger or whatever else gets dredged up by the end of a relationship.<p> Perhaps the book's most crucial chapter posits that the best way to get over the loss of love is to focus on the "love" more than the "loss." That may seem impossible, especially if the bum took off with your best friend, your life savings, and your Lyle Lovett CDs, but Gray didn't get to be a household name because the advice in his Venus and Mars books doesn't work. Remembering only the bad parts, Gray says, leaves you with an important part of your emotional being closed to new business.</p><p> As for the Venus and Mars stuff, that comes in the second half of the book, when Gray looks at how men and women start new relationships from different points of view, with different priorities (a man might want to have fun with no strings attached; a woman might carry with her a lengthy list of requirements for her next partner, a list that excludes virtually all available men). </p><p> If you've never read Gray's work before, you have to be prepared to check your cynicism at the door. This is earnest stuff, but it's also based on decades of experience counseling clients. He's not one of those photogenic, nine-times-divorced shrinklets who's telling you how to conduct your relationships without any real clue of what makes love last. This is the real package: nothing glib, nothing quick and easy, nothing you could've figured out from a "Love Is..." cartoon.</p>Starting over after a painful breakup, a divorce, or the loss of a loved one can be the most challenging experience of a lifetime. Drawing on insights derived from twenty-eight years of counseling thousands of men and women in making wise choices in the process of healing their hearts, John Gray has once again written a groundbreaking book--one that abundantly provides guidance and comfort to those who find themselves single again. With the processes John Gray has developed in counseling and leading workshops, <em>Mars &amp; Venus Starting Over</em> opens the door to finding a rich and fulfilling lifetime of love once again. <p> The first section of the book addresses the part of the healing process that is basically the same for men and women. Dealing with the pain of a breakup or loss is not easy, and John Gray makes it clear that although the pain of loss is an inevitable part of life, suffering is not. He explains that the heart often lags behind the mind, that we must experience our grief in order to become whole again. He compassionately shows us how to find forgiveness and explains how good endings make good beginnings. </p><p> Although the healing process is fundamentally the same, starting over on Venus is often different from starting over on Mars. Women tend to push love away to avoid getting hurt again. On the other hand, men often get involved right away, but have trouble committing. Part two, "Starting Over on Venus," explores the twenty-three common challenges women face, which include the new pressures of dating, glorifying our past, staying stuck in grief, overromanticizing, women who do too much, fear of intimacy, and putting children first. Part three, "Starting Over on Mars," deals with sex on the rebound, work, money, and love, living out fantasies, holding back, being in a hurry, bigger is better, and self-destructive tendencies--to name a few of the land mines men face on the road to healing. </p><p> <em>Mars &amp; Venus Starting Over</em> will inspire you to rise to the challenge of healing your heart and to move on to find an even greater love. You will fulfill your soul's deepest purpose--to love and to be loved. </p><p> </p><strong>There is hope! You will find love again...</strong><p>John Gray has helped millions of men and women develop better relationships with his phenomenal <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus</em>. </p><p> Now he turns his attention to the millions of people who find themselves single again and compassionately presents a process for healing a broken heart.

Demanding and enigmatic, patriarch Conrad Hilton&#39;s visionary ideas and unyielding will established the model for the modern luxury hotel industry. But outside the boardroom, Conrad struggled with emotional detachment, failed marriages, and conflicted Catholicism. Then there were his children: Playboy Nicky Hilton&#39;s tragic alcoholism and marriage to Elizabeth Taylor was the stuff of tabloid legend. Barron Hilton, on the other hand, deftly handled his father&#39;s legacy, carrying the Hilton brand triumphantly into the new millennium. Eric, raised apart from his older brothers, accepted his supporting role in the Hilton dynasty with calm and quiet-a stark contrast to the boys&#39; much younger half-sister Francesca, whose battle for recognition led her into courtrooms and conflict. The cast of supporting players includes the inimitable Zsa Zsa Gabor, who was married to Conrad briefly and remained a thorn in his side for decades, and a host of other Hollywood and business luminaries with whom the Hiltons crossed paths and swords over the years.</p><p>J. Randy Taraborrelli is a respected journalist, a recognizable entertainment personality, and in-demand guest on many television programs including <i>Today, Good Morning America, The Early Show, Entertainment Tonight,</i> and <i>CNN Headline News</i>. He is the bestselling author of thirteen books.Taraborrelli is a journalist and celebrity biographer. His family saga of the Hiltons is filled with enticing gossip as well as well-�documented, if sometimes tawdry, facts about various members. The founder of the hotel empire, Conrad Hilton, was certainly an interesting, in some ways admirable, but enigmatic character. Taraborrelli portrays him as a true visionary capable of thinking and dreaming on a large scale while keeping a firm hold upon economic realities. Yet he seems to have been a tortured soul who lacked a personal touch and, consequently, could not win affection or loyalty from business associates or family members. His successors, however, were not particularly interesting, and the author seems to be straining to make them worthy of his attention. Son Nicky, for example, best known as the first husband of Elizabeth Taylor, was a shallow, self-absorbed alcoholic; the current celebrity Hilton, Paris, seems both the perpetrator and the victim of her thirst for public attention. Taraborrelli is a good writer, who, in this case, would have benefited from more compelling subjects. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>3D Origami: Step-by-Step Illustrations</h2><p>Origami is created by folding small squares of paper into various shapes. <em>3D Origami</em> takes that tradition to the next level by combining smaller origami projects into three-dimensional structures.

Seeking to address the various challenges of off-camera lighting, professional photographers and advanced amateurs alike will find a range of confidence-building instruction, beginning with basic how&#x2019;s and why&#x2019;s of lighting for creative effect, the types of equipment available and instruction about their proper use, clear definitions of various technical concepts such as managing shutter speed and controlling flash exposure, using ambient light as well as natural sunlight during a shoot, and incorporating off-camera flash into a portrait session. Concluding this lesson plan is a look at five different real-life photo sessions, each employing a different flash technique. Here, photographers get a deeper understanding of each concept put into practice, marrying the elements of lighting with the natural elements presented by the shoot.</p><p>Neil van Niekerk is a professional photographer and the author of &#34;On-Camera Flash Techniques for Digital Wedding&#34;&#34;and&#34;&#34;Portrait Photography.&#34; He lives in Wayne, New Jersey."The best book I have read on the subject of shooting with your Speedlight on your hot shoe." &#x2014;www.WeeklyPhotoTips.blogspot.com on <i>On-Camera Flash Techniques for Digital Wedding and Portrait Photography</i><br><br>"This is the book you've been waiting for." &#x2014;www.RonMart.blogspot.com<br><br>"van Niekerk explains everything you need to know about properly using a flash to capture the best possible image each and every time." &#x2014;<i>Shutterbug</i><br><br>"Will definitely help you improve your off camera flash technique and ultimately your photography." &#x2014;www.EPhotoZine.com<br><br>"This book is interesting and educational." &#x2014;www.PortlandBookReview.com</p><h2>Authentic Vietnamese Cooking: Food from a Family Table</h2><p><p> Refined, subtle, challenging, and accessible all at the same time, the food of Vietnam was the first true fusion cuisine, blending the techniques and ingredients of French and Chinese culinary traditions. In <i>Authentic Vietnamese Cooking,</i> culinary writer and consultant Corinne Trang introduces you to the pleasures of regional Vietnamese cooking. Born in France's Loire Valley to a French mother and Cambodian-born Chinese father, and raised in Phnom Penh, Paris, and New York, Trang shares more than 100 delicious, authentic Vietnamese recipes designed especially for the home cook. </p><p> In this beautiful volume, the complicated processes of assimilation, adaptation, and evolution have been distilled into magnificent dishes that represent the three distinct culinary regions of Vietnam: the Simple North, the Sophisticated Center, and the Spicy South. There are recipes for family meals and special occasions, sauces, marinades, flavored oils, soups, noodle dishes, and more. </p><p> Trang translates the complex flavors of Vietnamese cuisine into easy-to-follow, step-by-step recipes, so even inexperienced cooks can create such classic dishes as <i>Cha Gio</i> (Spring Rolls), <i>Sup Cua Mang Tay</i> (Crab and Asparagus Soup), <i>Pho Bo</i> (Hanoi Beef and Rice Noodle Soup), <i>Tom Nuong Xa</i> (Grilled Lemongrass Prawns), <i>Ga Nuong Toi</i> (Garlic-Roasted Baby Chicken), and <i>Banh Gan</i> (Coconut Creme Caramel). </p><p> Enhanced by stunning photographs, <i>Authentic Vietnamese Cooking</i> also includes sections on essential ingredients, equipment, and techniques; sample seasonal menus: and a list of mail-order sources and Web sites for securing hard-to-find items. </p><p> Rich with historical, cultural, and personal anecdotes, <i>Authentic Vietnamese Cooking</i> brings the experience and pleasures of Corinne Trang's family table to yours.</p></p><p><i>Authentic Vietnamese Cooking</i> offers remarkable insight into the history and details of this seemingly simple yet enchantingly sophisticated cuisine. Author Corinne Trang shares the story of her family, starting with her grandparents, who emigrated from Hunan, China, to Cambodia and then to Vietnam. Eventually, Trang herself made homes in Paris and New York, as well as Asia. The resulting blending of cultures and culinary traditions in her family is a common experience for Southeast Asians who, over the centuries, have had to flee from one place to the next to survive despotism, hunger, and war. <p> Trang clarifies the distinctions between dishes from the three regions of Vietnam. There is the Simple North, where stir-fries are common and the seven-course beef meal, Bo By Mon, originated. The Sophisticated Center features Chao Tom, shrimp paste grilled on lengths of sugar cane created to please the wealthy families of Hue. In the Spicy South, sea trade with India, plus Cambodian influences, led to the development of aromatic, golden curries. Today, the Vietnamese serve them with Banh Mi, the light, crusty Saigon baguette made with rice and wheat flour.</p><p> In addition to the four groups of condiments essential to Vietnamese cooking (sweet, pungent Nuoc Cham, vinegared vegetables, sate, and table salad), Trang gives recipes for rice-paper-wrapped Summer Rolls, filled with rice noodles, pork, and shrimp, and Mint Rice with Shredded Chicken. Requiring only rice, chicken stock, shallots, fresh mint, and cooked chicken, it has the clean and layered flavors typical of Vietnamese food. Western sensibilities may recoil at Trang's brief, honest discussion of the exotic meats served in Vietnam, including dog, snake, and monkey, served mostly to demonstrate machismo or status (no recipes are given). Christopher Hirsheimer's artistic black-and-white photos enhance the poetic simplicity of Trang's deeply involving text. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p><b>Corinne Trang</b> writes and consults for a number of publications, including <i>Moneysworth, Bottom Line Personal, City NY, Saveur,</i> and <i>Food &amp; Wine.</i> She has prepared and styled food for various cookbooks and television shows and was formerly producing editor and director of the test kitchen for the award-winning magazine <i>Saveur.</i> She lives in New York City.</p><h2>Albert Einstein: A Biography</h2><p>A biography of Albert Einstein also delves into his development both personally and as a scientist, exploring everything from his childhood idiosyncrasies to overheard conversations with colleagues</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanAnother full-scale biography, this one translated from the German, of the preeminent physicist of modern times. F&#x201d;lsing (head of science for the North German Radio/Television Network) recognizes that Albert Einstein (18791955) was a complex man whose importance went far beyond his enormous contributions to science. However, as the author (himself a physicist by training) points out, physics was Einstein's ``passion and his life,'' and many of the other events of his life--his involvement in politics, his celebrity status, his efforts on behalf of the Jewish people- -were more in the nature of distractions from his true calling. So while the present volume does not skimp in its treatment of Einstein's life outside science, physics provides the central focus--and, unfortunately, its central weakness. Readers without considerable scientific background may feel that F&#x201d;lsing fails to adequately explain many of the central questions to which Einstein addressed himself. On the other hand, F&#x201d;lsing offers a fascinating picture of the life of a scientist in the first half of this century. Einstein's school career, his job at the Swiss patent office, his movement into the academic world (and the political maneuvers this involved), and his acceptance by the international scientific community are covered in marvelous detail. Einstein's private life has been the subject of some controversy; however, despite having access to many previously unpublished letters, F&#x201d;lsing has little to contribute to such questions as whether Einstein's first wife, Mileva, had any substantial input into the theory of relativity. Einstein's later years, from the accession of Hitler in 1933 to the scientist's death, are given remarkably short shrift. The translation, with numerous muddy patches and unidiomatic translations, often falls short of clarity. While it sheds interesting light on many aspects of Einstein's life, this biography will be of more interest to the specialist than to the general reader. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In She, which Windham was putting the finishing touches on when she died in June 2011, the author describes how she woke up one day to find that she had an unwanted houseguest, an old woman who had suddenly moved into her home and was taking over her life. Windham referred to this interloper simply as She, and here the reader has been invited into the lively colloquy between the author -- whose spirit has not changed -- and her alter ego, who moves haltingly toward her earthly end. She will leave you laughing and crying, but also grateful and hopeful.</p><p>Kathryn Tucker Windham grew up in Thomasville, Alabama. She graduated from Huntingdon College in 1939, married Amasa Benjamin Windham in 1946, and had three children before being widowed in 1956. A newspaper reporter by profession, her career spanned four decades, beginning in the shadow of the Great Depression and continuing through the Civil Rights Movement, which she observed at ground level in her adopted home town of Selma. In the 1970s, she left journalism and worked as a coordinator for a federally funded agency for programs for the elderly. She continued to write, take photographs, and tell stories. The storytelling was an outgrowth of her 1969 book, 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey. More volumes of ghost stories, folklore, recipes, and essays followed; she has now published more than twenty books. Her reputation as a storyteller led to thirty-three appearances over an eighteen-month period on National Public Radio&#x2019;s All Things Considered, which introduced her to an even larger audience. She has written, produced, and acted in a one-woman play, My Name Is Julia, about pioneering social reformer Julia Tutwiler, has narrated several television documentaries, and is a regular interviewee for national and international journalists visiting Alabama in search of the Old or the New South. It is a testament to the good humor, keen intelligence, and life-long curiosity of one of the region&#x2019;s best known public citizens that she can guide visitors unerringly to either mythical place."With her trademark humor, Kathryn Tucker Windham addresses the reality of getting to an advanced age." &#x2015;Dave &#x201c;Doc&#x201d; Kirby, Book Bites <br> "This little book is good-natured, wise, realistic but also optimistic in its way. Windham&#x2019;s many fans will enjoy it and She may bring her a few new fans as well." &#x2015;Don Noble, First Draft</p><h2>The Mystics of the Church</h2><p>This little book only hints at the richness and variety of the material with which anyone who tries to tell the spiritual history of the Christian Church will have to muddle through. The author has selected a few of those mystical saints whose greatness is most closely connected with their dependence on and contribution to the family life of the household of faith.</p><p>Eveylyn Underhill died in 1941.

T. Wright's Jesus &amp; the Victory of God</h2><p>N. T. Wright's <em>Jesus and the Victory of God</em> is widely heralded as one of the most significant and brilliantly argued works in the current "third quest" of the historical Jesus. In this second volume of his multivolume investigation entitled Christian Origins and the Question of God, Wright uncovers a Jesus that most historians and believers have never met. Rooted and engaged in the soil of Israel's history, its first-century plight and its prophetic hope, Wright's portrait of Jesus has set new terms of discourse and debate. Through Wright's lens, familiar sayings and actions of Jesus have fresh meaning. But in the midst of all that is new, Wright also offers a profile of Jesus that bears striking lines of continuity with the Jesus of Christian belief and worship. This resemblance has captured the attention of confessing Christian biblical scholars and theologians. Wright's work thus far is of such consequence that it seemed timely and strategic to publish a scholarly engagement with his reconstruction of the historical Jesus. Like all works in progress, Wright's proposal is still under construction. But its cornerstone has been laid, the foundation has been formed, the pillars and walls are going up, and even if we cannot yet see how the ceiling, roof and parapets will look, there is quite enough to engage the minds of colleagues, critics and other curious onlookers. For the purposes of this book (and in keeping with IVP's own evangelical identity), editor Carey Newman invited scholars who are committed to Christian belief as it has been classically defined to engage Wright's <em>Jesus and the Victory of God.</em> Newman sets the stage with an introduction, and Craig Blomberg offers a critical and appreciative overview of <em>Jesus and the Victory of God.</em> Various facets of Wright's proposal are then investigated by contributors: <ul><li>Paul Eddy on Jesus as prophet, Messiah and embodiment of Yahweh</li><li>Klyne Snodgrass on the parables</li><li>Craig Evans on Israel under continuing exile</li><li>Darrell Bock on the trial and death of Jesus</li><li>Dale Allison on apocalyptic language</li><li>Richard Hays on ethics</li><li>Alister McGrath on the implications for evangelical theology</li><li>Stephen Evans on methodological naturalism in historical biblical scholarship</li><li>Luke Timothy Johnson on Wright's historiography</li></ul> To these essayists Wright extends his "grateful dialogue." He gives this spirited and illuminating reply to his interlocuters: "The high compliment of having a whole book devoted to the discussion of one's work is finely balanced by the probing, intelligent questions and by the occasional thud of a blunt instrument on the back of one's head. . . . Only once did I look up my lawyer's telephone number." After Wright takes his turn, his good friend and frequent partner in debate Marcus Borg offers his "appreciative disagreement." Newman then concludes the dialogue with his own reflections on moving from Wright's reconstruction of the historical Jesus to the church's Christ. A book assessing a scholar's work is usually an end-of-career event. But in this case interested readers can look forward with eager anticipation to Wright's next volume in Christian Origins and the Question of God--this one on the resurrection of Jesus.</p><p>"Jesus just won't go away," begins the editor of this collection of essays. Devoted to the massive and influential study by the theologian N.T. Wright, <i>Jesus and the Victory of God</i>, this current volume assembles a dozen or so leading scholars to assess the importance--and accuracy--of Wright's 600-page study of the historical Jesus. More than a simple tribute to this English scholar, the writers in the volume, who are mainly assembled from the conservative wings of the church (with Marcus Borg representing the more liberal "Jesus Seminar" interpreters), clearly wish to clarify and deepen their own interpretations even while affirming the richness and depth of Wright's approach. As the editor states, readers here will find essays "by historians of Second Temple Judaism, Scripture scholars, systematic theologians and philosophers." As a result, even without reading Wright's own book, this volume can give the reader a very clear snapshot of much of New Testament studies as it (and we) begin a new millennium. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>Carey C.

Created in the media of copper, shell, stone, clay, and wood, and incised or carved with a complex set of symbols and motifs, this seven-hundred-year-old artistic tradition functioned within a multiethnic landscape centered on communities dominated by earthen mounds and plazas. Previous researchers have referred to this material as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC).</p> <p>This groundbreaking volume brings together ten essays by leading anthropologists, archaeologists, and art historians, who analyze the iconography of Mississippian art in order to reconstruct the ritual activities, cosmological vision, and ideology of these ancient precursors to several groups of contemporary Native Americans. Significantly, the authors correlate archaeological, ethnographic, and art historical data that illustrate the stylistic differences within Mississippian art as well as the numerous changes that occur through time. The research also demonstrates the inadequacy of the SECC label, since Mississippian art is not limited to the Southeast and reflects stylistic changes over time among several linked but distinct religious traditions. The term Mississippian Iconographic Interaction Sphere (MIIS) more adequately describes the corpus of this Mississippian art. Most important, the authors illustrate the overarching nature of the ancient Native American religious system, as a creation unique to the native American cultures of the eastern United States.</p></p><p>F.

A magnificent display of the late Albert Hourani&#39;s lifetime of scholarship, it was a best-seller on first publication in 1991.</p><p><b>Albert Hourani</b> was Emeritus Fellow, St. Antony's College, Oxford.

Pr., 1983) and The Emergence of the Modern Middle East (Univ. of California Pr., 1980). This work, the first full-scale single-volume history of the Arabic-speaking peoples of the Islamic world in several decades, begins with Islam's rise in the 7th century and carries the rich and imposing story of Arab civilization to the late 1980s. In broad, sweeping strokes, Hourani moves easily from mosque to marketplace, from sultan to imam , from nomad to city-dweller, from Mohammed to Sadat. He dwells on the Ottoman Empire and on the European colonialism that followed, and concludes with a discussion of the modern resurgence of Islam that offers hope to thousands of Muslims and appears so threatening to Westerners.

He writes for two hours a day and spends quite a lot of time walking his dog and playing bridge. Most recently Louis has been writing the screenplay of his novel HOLES, which is being made in to a film starring Jon Voigt, Sigourney Weaver and Patricia Arquette. Louis will also make a brief appearance in the film.Grade 5-7-At the end of Holes (Farrar, 1998), Camp Green Lake seemed destined to become a Girl Scout camp. However, as Stanley explains, the award-winning book caught the attention of get-tough politicians who liked the notion of hard work and discipline. So, they reopened the infamous juvenile-detention center, rehired the malicious staff, and, of course, reinstituted the hole-digging regimen. As a camp survivor, Stanley tries to provide new inmates with the vital information they will need to endure their sentences-including a discussion of how the system works, hole-construction techniques, and desert wildlife dangers. He enhances his account with anecdotes about his former campmates, elaborating on incidents and characters from Holes. The book is written in pop survival-manual style and even includes sample situations and survival questions, although the answers are often quite unexpected.

Lee, Stonewall Jackson, J. E. B. Stuart, and many lesser commanders. But while the tarnish on such statues has done nothing to color the reputation of those great leaders, there remains one Confederate commander whose tarnished image has nothing to do with bronze monuments. Nowhere in the South does a memorial stand to Lee's intimate friend and second-in-command James Longstreet.<p>In <i>Lee's Tarnished Lieutenant</i>, William Garrett Piston examines the life of James Longstreet and explains how a man so revered during the course of the war could fall from grace so swiftly and completely. Unlike other generals in gray whose deeds are familiar to southerners and northerners alike, Longstreet has the image not of a hero but of an incompetent who lost the Battle of Gettysburg and, by extension, the war itself. Piston's reappraisal of the general's military record establishes Longstreet as an energetic corps commander with an unsurpassed ability to direct troops in combat, as a trustworthy subordinate willing to place the war effort above personal ambition. He made mistakes, but Piston shows that he did not commit the grave errors at Gettysburg and elsewhere of which he was so often accused after the war.</p><p>In discussing Longstreet's postwar fate, Piston analyzes the literature and public events of the time to show how the southern people, in reaction to defeat, evolved an image of themselves which bore little resemblance to reality. As a product of the Georgia backwoods, Longstreet failed to meet the popular cavalier image embodied by Lee, Stuart, and other Confederate heroes. When he joined the Republican party during Reconstruction, Longstreet forfeited his wartime reputation and quickly became a convenient target for those anxious to explain how a "superior people" could have lost the war. His new role as the villain of the Lost Cause was solidified by his own postwar writings. Embittered by years of social ostracism resulting from his Republican affiliation, resentful of the orchestrated deification of Lee and Stonewall Jackson, Longstreet exaggerated his own accomplishments and displayed a vanity that further alienated an already offended southern populace.</p><p>Beneath the layers of invective and vilification remains a general whose military record has been badly maligned. <i>Lee's Tarnished Lieutenant</i> explains how this reputation developed--how James Longstreet became, in the years after Appomattox, the scapegoat for the South's defeat, a Judas for the new religion of the Lost Cause.</p></p><p>William Garrett Piston received his Ph.D. in history from the University of South Carolina. He has taught at the University of South Carolina and the Louise S. McGehee School in New Orleans."A welcome account of the military career of General James P. Longstreet, one of the Civil War's most competent corps commanders, but also one of its most vilified. After some brief biographical data, the text plunges headlong into the events of the great conflict, which saw Longstreet participating in many of its most important battles (Manassas, Antietam, Chickamauga, etc.). Piston's major focus, however, is Gettysburg, at which Longstreet has historically been accused of malfeasance in not complying efficiently with the orders of Confederate General Robert E. Lee . . . Piston effectively sets the record straight on Longstreet's behalf; the facts are that Lee blew it at Gettysburg (though there will always be those who disagree). An excellent piece of American military biography.&#x201d;&#x2014;Booklist</p><h2>Funeral in Blue (William Monk Novels)</h2><p>In her haunting new Victorian novel, Anne Perry brings to rich and passionate life the city that she has made her own.

They have a runaway to protect, a doll they found in a mysterious package who they think might be Annabelle&#39;s long-lost sister. Lynn Redgrave narrates with a measured cadence that allows the story to gently unfold, and her distinct vocalizations for each of the dolls make it easy to follow the plot. In particular, Redgrave gives Annabelle&#39;s new sister a light, innocent voice that is fitting for the inquisitiveness of a young child. This character trait adds humor to the moments when she&#39;s also exceedingly knowledgeable, given all the things she heard during her many years in the misplaced box.

His family&#x2019;s roots in Palestine traced back to the Middle Ages, and his father was the governor of Jerusalem. Educated at Oxford, he was trained to build upon his father&#x2019;s support for coexistence and a negotiated solution to the problems of the region.<br><br>But the wars of 1967 and 1973 spelled the beginning of the end for the vision of a unified Palestine&#x2014;and Nusseibeh&#x2019;s response to these events, and to those that followed, gives us the recent history from a Palestinian point of view as no book has done. From his time teaching side by side with Israelis at Hebrew University through his appointment by Yassir Arafat to administer Arab Jerusalem, he holds fast to a two-state solution, even as the powers around him insist that it is impossible. As Palestine is torn apart by settlements and barricades, corruption and violence, Nusseibeh remains true to the ideals of his youth, determined to keep hold of some faint hope for the life of his country.<br><br><i>Once Upon a Country </i>is a book with the scope and vitality of an old-fashioned novel&#x2014;one whose ending is still uncertain.</p><p><b>Sari Nusseibeh</b>, a philosopher, was the Palestine Liberation Organization&#x2019;s chief representative in Jerusalem from 2001 to 2002, in which role he advocated a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. He is the president of and a professor at Al-Quds University, the Arab University of Jerusalem. Nusseibeh was educated at Oxford and Harvard, and was a Radcliffe Institute Fellow at Harvard for 2004&#x2013;05. He is the author of two previous books.Prologue&nbsp;A Fairy Tale&nbsp;Almost forty years ago the Israeli army conquered Jerusalem, a city my family had lived in since the days of Omar the Great, and soon afterward I fell in love with Lucy. Everyone agreed at the time, including the two of us, that it was an odd match. We were both students at Oxford, which at least on the surface was where our similarities ended. Lucy was the daughter of John Austin, one of England&#x2019;s mightiest modern philosophers, and I was the nineteen-year-old son of a man who had spent the last twenty years serving a Jordanian-administered Palestine, an entity recently wiped off the map in six brief days. Lucy was expected to marry into the British intelligentsia and to pursue a dazzling academic career of her own. By contrast, I no longer had a country, and the old ruling class my father represented had been plunged into a crisis from which it would never recover. The children of the privileged and educated, including all five of my siblings, began heading for the exits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I intended to stay in exile, the love that Lucy and I shared perhaps would have raised fewer eyebrows. But I wanted to return, and I wanted her to go with me. But how do you ask the daughter of a famous Oxford don to follow you to the war-scarred, embattled, poor, and occupied city of Jerusalem? How do you break the news that your fate will be tied to one of the most volatile corners on the planet, with two major wars in its recent history and the Arab leaders worldwide calling for another? It seemed too preposterous even to try, so I wrote a fairy tale instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was second nature for me to use myth to get across something so important. At the time I was, as I remain, under the thrall of Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland, for in it I saw how a children&#x2019;s yarn could say more than a dozen philosophical treatises.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy tales are also in my blood, and how could it be otherwise, with my having been raised surrounded by such a timeless and magical landscape? When my ancestors arrived in Jerusalem from Arabia thirteen centuries ago, the city&#x2019;s history was already so hallowed by time&#x2014;and of course by the ancient Jewish prophets who once roamed its streets&#x2014;that it left the newcomers from the desert in awe. That awe was so strong that as a child 1,300 years later, I couldn&#x2019;t walk to the corner market without feeling it all the way to my fingertips. Sometimes, when I watched my uncle&#x2019;s camels graze among ruins of Suq al-Khawajat, or Goldsmith&#x2019;s Souk, which had belonged to the Nusseibehs from time immemorial, the sensation of being a character in an ancient story swept through me&#x2014;as it did when I watched a different uncle, the doorkeeper of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, take a foot-long skeleton key and, as in the story that my Christian friends told me of St. Peter and the Pearly Gates, unlock a door thick enough to withstand a battering ram. In a city whose lanes were too narrow and crooked for a tank, this massive oak door still gave off a sense of impenetrability.&nbsp;&nbsp;After snatching the city away from the Byzantine Empire in the seventh century, Omar the Great made our family&#x2019;s ancestor High Judge of Jerusalem, and from that point on my family has served the Holy City as judges, teachers, Sufi sages, politicians, and as doorkeepers to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.&nbsp;&nbsp;With all this in my background, my fairy tale&#x2019;s first line was as truthful as it was unsubtle: &#x201c;Oh how I wish I could go to the Holy Land.&#x201d; The rest of the story is about an angel on a flying donkey who takes an English girl named Louise on a ride to Jerusalem. The model for my story was Mohammed&#x2019;s Night Journey to Jerusalem, my favorite childhood fable. One evening the Prophet mounted a winged steed named al-Burak, Arabic for &#x201c;lightning,&#x201d; and took a magical trip that over time would inspire the tales of flying carpets. Apart from the revelation of the Koran, in the only miracle ever associated with the Muslim prophet, Mohammed flew on al-Burak&#x2019;s back over the endless dunes and rock deserts of Arabia to a land described in the Koran as holy and blessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination of the Night Journey was the site of Solomon&#x2019;s ancient temple in Jerusalem and the place, according to Jewish tradition, of Abraham&#x2019;s sacrifice. To be more precise, he and his steed landed on the rock where some say Adam was created, and where he first set foot on earth after his expulsion from Paradise. (They&#x2019;ll also tell you that if you look closely enough, you&#x2019;ll see his footprints.) It is from that rock that the Prophet then ascended to heaven to receive instructions for the Abrahamic message of Islam, or faith in the one God.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the yarn I wrote for Lucy, after an angel wearing a turban and riding the magical donkey whisks Louise away to Jerusalem, she meets a variety of characters, including Mr. Seems, who is never what he seems to be. Another figure she encounters stands guard at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Since the time of the Crusades, this knight of the Holy Sepulcher has been asleep at the same spot, as rigid as the tin man in The Wizard of Oz, and just as teary eyed, because a thousand years ago he vowed not to budge until there was peace in the Holy Land.&nbsp;&nbsp;While at Oxford, I never finished the tale. I got Louise as far as Jerusalem, but I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what to do with her once she arrived. Would she help awaken the Crusader knight outside the Holy Sepulcher? Would she help bring peace to the Holy Land? I was stumped.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Lucy didn&#x2019;t need a fairy tale to fall in love with Jerusalem: before I wrote the story she had already spent time in the Holy Land, while on tour with an Oxford choir, and had begun to identify with the landscape, history, language, and people with as much avidity as a native.&nbsp;&nbsp;And so for more than thirty-five years my tale sat in a drawer, untitled and unfinished, and the knight remained very much asleep. More pressing matters&#x2014;academic work, family life, and three decades of war and upheaval&#x2014;got in the way. It was only last year, as I was preparing for my upcoming fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard, that I picked up the tale again. I asked my twelve-year-old daughter, Nuzha, bedridden with the flu at the time, for her opinion on its merits. An avid and critical reader of stories and an aspiring writer herself, she gave me the thumbs-up, and I packed the tale along with the rest of my things to take to America. So as the institute&#x2019;s distinguished mathematicians, historians, and biologists pursued their academic and scientific endeavors, I worked on my fairy tale.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim, of course, was no longer to persuade Lucy to run off with me to Jerusalem. Now other motives had surfaced. Lucy and I now had our own children, who had to make their own decision as to whether to stay in a land far more mired in tragedy and seething with resentment than it was after the Six-Day War. Could I so easily say to my children, as I said to Lucy back then, that a life in Palestine would be an adventure? Even if I tried, they would never respond as Louise does in the tale. (&#x201c;It would be so exciting . . . Just think,&#x201d; she pleaded, with her palms pressed together as if in prayer.) The only way to convince them about the possibility of a future in Palestine was to make a good case that our conflict with Israel could be solved. Somehow I had to wake up the sleeping knight in front of the Holy Sepulcher.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeks of toil resulted in some new characters and a couple of mystical Sufi riddles. But I still didn&#x2019;t know how to awaken the sleeping knight. No wonder, for after decades of effort, the magical formula for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seemed more elusive than ever. The Goldsmith&#x2019;s Souk, my favorite haunt as a child, had been taken over by a sect of messianic Israeli settlers, who had turned the ruins into a flourishing colony&#x2014;but also a strategic dagger thrust into the center of the Muslim Quarter. More seriously, the country had been ruined by armed conflict. Suicide bombers had invaded Israeli cities, and the Israeli army had responded by reoccupying the West Bank. The Oslo Agreement was in shambles, and whatever was left of Arafat&#x2019;s rule in the Occupied Territories was being challenged by Islamic extremism. Meanwhile, the Israelis were using terrorism as a pretext for erecting the &#x201c;Security Fence,&#x201d; a twenty-foot-high concrete wall that began to weave its way through the West Bank like some malevolent snake. Each time I returned to Jerusalem for important meetings at Al-Quds University, where I work, I had to be shadowed by my two bodyguards, ubiquitous, like characters in Kafka&#x2019;s The Castle. Far from peaceful New England, my bodyguards reminded me just how asleep my fictional knight remained.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to the riddle came to me on a plane returning to Boston after Chairman Arafat&#x2019;s funeral.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days earlier, I had been at the Skidmore College lodge preparing for a lecture I was to deliver the following day when an urgent message came from Jerusalem. Chairman Arafat, enfeebled and holed up in his destroyed compound encircled by Israeli tanks, had succumbed to a mysterious illness. Chairman Arafat hadn&#x2019;t been a well man for some years. The last time I met with him, before leaving for my sabbatical, he had looked gaunt and frail. When he fell ill this last time, he was flown to Paris, where a few days later he died. The Old Man, as he was known, was gone. That evening I cut short my stay in beauti...</p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Secret Bankers: The Myth of Swiss Neutrality During the Holocaust</h2><p>No death certificates were issued at Auschwitz, but today Swiss bankers still demand them before they will release to relatives the assets of account holders killed in the Holocaust. Based on newly declassified documents and archival research, Hitler&#39;s Secret Banks reveals the full, hitherto unknown extent of Swiss economic collaboration with the Nazis.</p><p>LeBor, the central European correspondent for the London Times, has added another book to the growing list about the conduct of Swiss bankers in connection with the Holocaust. Based in Budapest, LeBor usually writes about Hungarian affairs, and it shows here. His opening chapters describe German atrocities in Hungary during World War II, which is compelling reading but doesn't have much to do with the grotesque behavior of the Swiss bankers during and after the war. LeBor's subsequent account of the United States's wartime involvement with the Swiss and the Germans through the Bank for International Settlements makes for fascinating reading and could point to the next Holocaust banking scandal. Nevertheless, libraries will be better off with Tom Bower's Nazi Gold (LJ 5/15/97), which makes better use of primary sources and tells a more coherent story.?Randall L. Schroeder, Wartburg Coll.

In addition to the title novella, it includes two Tarzan short stories. Of the three pieces, "Tarzan and the Jungle Murders" was written first, in January 1939. It was first published in the magazine Thrilling Adventures in the issue for June 1940. "Tarzan and the Champion" was written in July 1939, and first published in Blue Book Magazine in the issue for April 1940. "The Quest of Tarzan" was begun in November 1940 and first published in the magazine Argosy Weekly as a three-part serial in the issues for August 23, August 30, and September 6, 1941. The three stories were gathered together and first published in book form in hardcover by Canaveral Press in 1965.

Breathtaking in its range and erudition, it explores Shiite festivals and the English Civil war, the finger exercises of monkeys and the effects of inflation in Weimar Germany. In this study of the interplay of crowds, Canetti offers one of the most profound and startling portraits of the human condition.</p></p><p>Elias Canetti's 1981 Nobel Prize was awarded mainly on the basis of this, his masterwork of philosophical anthropology about <i>la condition humaine</i> on an overpopulated planet. <p> Ranging from soccer crowds and political rallies to Bushmen and the pilgrimage to Mecca, Canetti exhaustively reviews the way crowds form, develop, and dissolve, using this taxonomy of mass movement as a key to the dynamics of social life. The style is abstract, erudite, and anecdotal, which makes <i>Crowds and Power</i> the sort of work that awes some readers with its profundity while irritating others with its elusiveness. Canetti loves to say something brilliant but counterintuitive, and then leave the reader to figure out both why he said it and whether it's really true. <i>--Richard Farr</i></p><p><b>Elias Canetti </b>(1905-94) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981.

Enlivened at unexpected moments by sexual exploration, mysticism, and flashes of wit alternately dry and hilarious, her prose is spare and honed, her stories filled with subtly sly characterizations of men and, mostly, women, dissatisfied not so much with the downward spiral of their fortunes as with the hollowness of their neat little lives. Whether focused on the separate emergences of Miss Goering and Mrs. Copperfield from their affluent, airless lives in New York and Panama into a less defined but intense sexual and social maelstrom in the novella <i>Two Serious Ladies</i>, or on the doomed efforts of the neighbors Mr. Drake and Mrs. Perry to form a connection out of their very different loneliness in "Plain Pleasures," or on the bittersweet cultural collision of an American wife and a peasant woman in Morocco in "Everything Is Nice," Jane Bowles creates whole worlds out of the unexpressed longings of individuals, adrift in their own lives, whether residing in their childhood homes or in faraway lands that are somehow both stranger and more familiar than what they left behind.</p></p><p><p><b>Jane Bowles</b> has long had an underground reputation as one of the truly original writers of this century.

It was May and the breeze was warm and smelled of salt spray and schools of feeding white trout, and high above me pelicans floated on the warm air currents, their extended wings gilded in the sunlight, until suddenly one would drop from the sky like a bomb from its rack, its wings cocked back against its sides, and explode against the water's surface and then rise dripping with a menhaden or a mullet flapping from its pouched beak. </p><p> But the sky had been streaked with red at dawn, and I knew that by afternoon thunderheads would roll out of the south, the temperature would suddenly drop twenty degrees, as though all the air had suddenly been sucked out from under an enormous dark bowl, and the blackened sky would tremble with trees of lightning. </p><p> I had always loved the Gulf, no matter if it was torn with storms or if the surf was actually frozen with green ridges of ice. Even when I was a police officer in New Orleans, I had lived in a houseboat on Lake Pontchartrain and spent my off days fishing down in Lafourche Parish and Barataria Bay, and even though I was in homicide I sometimes worked deals through the boys in vice so I could go along on the Coast Guard cutter when they went after the dope runners out on the salt. </p><p> Now I owned a bait and boat-rental business on the bayou south of New Iberia, and twice a week my wife, Annie, and I headed out Southwest Pass in my converted jug boat and trawled for shrimp. It was called a "jug boat" because years ago it had been designed by an oil company for retrieving the long, thick, rubber-coated cables and seismic instruments used in marine oil exploration; it was long, narrow, and flat, with a big Chrysler engine, two screws, and the pilot's cab flush against the stern. Annie and I had outfitted it with ice bins, a bait well, winches for the nets, a small galley, fishing and scuba gear boxes welded to the gunnels, and even a big, canvas Cinzano umbrella that I could open up over a bridge table and folding chairs. </p><p> On mornings like this we'd trawl in a big circle through the Pass, the bow almost out of the water with the bursting weight of the net, then we'd load the ice bins full with pink-blue shrimp, set out the rods for gafftop catfish, and fix lunch in the galley while the boat drifted against the anchor rope in the warm wind. On this morning Annie had boiled a pot of shrimp and bluepoint crabs and was cleaning the shrimp in a bowl to mix with a pan of dirty rice we had brought from home. I had to smile as I watched her; she was my Mennonite-Kansas girl, with curly gold hair that lifted on the nape of her neck in the breeze, and eyes that were the most electric blue I had ever seen. She wore a man's faded denim shirt with the tails hanging over her white ducks, and canvas shoes with no socks; she had learned to clean fish and shrimp and handle a boat in a gale as well as if she had been born in the bayou country, but she would always remain my Kansas girl, sewn together from bluebonnets and sunflowers, tilting awkwardly on high heels, always awed by cultural difference and what she called "weirdness" in other people, although she came from a background of wheat-farmer pacifists that was so pervasively eccentric that she couldn't recognize normality when she saw it. </p><p> She had a tan even in winter, and the smoothest skin I had ever touched. Small lights played in her eyes when you looked into them. She saw me smiling at her, set down the bowl of shrimp, and walked past me as though she were going to check the rods, then I felt her behind me, felt her breasts touch the back of my head, then her hands collapsed my hair like a tangle of black snakes in my eyes, and her fingers traced my face, my brush mustache, my shoulders, the <i>pungi-</i>stick scar on my stomach that looked like a flattened, gray worm, until her innocent love made me feel that all my years, my love handles, my damaged liver were not important at all. Maybe I had grown foolish, or perhaps fond is a better word, in the way that an aging animal doesn't question its seduction by youth. But her love wasn't a seduction; it was unrelenting and always there, even after a year of marriage, and she gave it eagerly and without condition. She had a strawberry birthmark high up on her right breast, and when she made love her heart filled it with blood until it became a dark red. She moved around the chair, sat on my lap, rubbed her hand across the thin film of sweat on my chest, and touched her curly hair against my cheek. She shifted her weight in my lap, felt me under her, looked knowingly into my eyes, and whispered as though we could be heard, "Let's get the air mattress out of the locker." </p><p> "What are you going to do if the Coast Guard plane goes over?" </p><p> "Wave." </p><p> "What if one of the reels goes out?" </p><p> "I'll try to keep your mind on something else." </p><p> I looked away from her toward the southern horizon. </p><p> "Dave?" </p><p> "It's a plane." </p><p> "How often do you get propositioned by your own wife? Don't let opportunity pass, skipper." Her blue eyes were merry and full of light. </p><p> "No, look. He's in trouble." </p><p> It was a bright yellow, two-engine job, and a long trail of thick black smoke blew from behind the cabin all the way across the sky to the horizon. The pilot was trying hard to gain altitude, gunning both engines, but the wingtips wobbled from side to side and wouldn't stabilize and the water was coming up fast. He went past us and I could see faces in the glass windows. The smoke twisted out of a ragged hole just in front of the tail. </p><p> "Oh, Dave, I thought I saw a child," Annie said. </p><p> The pilot must have been trying to make Pecan Island so he could pancake into the salt grass, but suddenly pieces of the rudder shredded away like strips of wet cardboard and the plane dipped violently to port and turned in a half-circle, both engines stalling now, the smoke curling as thick and black as smoke from an oil fire, and went down hard on one wing against the water's surface, flipped over in the air like a stick toy, and landed upside-down in a huge spray of green and white water and floating seaweed. </p><p> The water boiled and danced on the overheated engine housings, and the hole in back actually seemed to create and suck a river deep inside the plane. In seconds the bright yellow underside of the plane was dimming in the low waves that slid across it. I couldn't see the doors, but I kept waiting for somebody in a life preserver to break through the surface. Instead, big balloons of air rose from the cabin, and a dirty slick of oil and gasoline was already obscuring the sun's winking refraction off the wings. </p><p> Annie was on the shortwave to the Coast Guard. I pulled the anchor free of the mud, threw it rattling into the bow, turned the big Chrysler engine over, heard the exhausts cough below the waterline, and hit it full throttle for the wreck. The wind and spray were like a cool slap in my face. But all I could see of the plane now were small gold lights in the floating blue-green stain of oil and gas leaking from broken fuel lines. </p><p> "Take the wheel," I said. </p><p> I saw her thoughts gathering in her face. </p><p> "We didn't refill the air tanks last time," she said. </p><p> "There's still some in there. It's not more than twenty-five feet here, anyway. If they haven't settled into the silt, I can get the doors open." </p><p> "Dave, it's deeper than twenty-five feet. You know it is. There's a trench right through the Pass." </p><p> I got the two air tanks out of the gear box and looked at the gauges. They both showed almost empty. I stripped down to my skivvies, hooked on a weight belt, put on one air tank and a mask, and slipped the canvas straps of the other tank over my arm. I picked up a crowbar out of the gear box. </p><p> "Anchor outside so one of them doesn't come up under the boat," I said. </p><p> "Leave the other tank. I'm going down, too." She had cut back the throttle, and the boat was pitching in its own wake. The side of her tanned face was wet with spray, and her hair was stuck to it. </p><p> "We need you up here, babe," I said, and went over the side. </p><p> "Damn you, Dave," I heard her say just as I plummeted with a clank of metal tanks through the water's surface. </p><p> The bottom of the Gulf was a museum of nautical history. Snorkel and scuba diving over the years, I had found clusters of Spanish cannonballs welded together with coral, U.S. Navy practice torpedoes, and the flattened hull of a Nazi submarine that had been depth-charged in 1942, a cigarette boat that dope runners had opened the cocks on before the Coast Guard had nailed them, and even the collapsed and twisted wreckage of the offshore oil rig on which my father drowned over twenty years ago. It lay on its side in the murk in eighty feet of water, and the day I swam down to it the steel cables whipped and sang against the stanchions like hammers ringing against an enormous saw blade. </p><p> The plane had settled upside down on the edge of the trench, its propellers dug deep in the gray sand. Strings of bubbles rose from the wings and windows. I felt the water grow colder as I went deeper, and now I could see crabs and jewfish moving quickly across the bottom and puffs of sand from the wings of stingrays that undulated and glided like shadows down the sides of the trench. </p><p> I got down to the pilot's door, slipped the spare tank off my arm, and looked through the window. He stared back at me upside down, his blond hair waving in the current, his sightless green eyes like hard, watery marbles. A short, thick-bodied woman with long black hair was strapped into the seat next to him, and her arms floated bac...</p></p><h2>TEKS United States History Since 1877 (Teachers Edition)</h2><p>TEKS United States History since 1877 (Teachers Edition)</p><p></p><h2>On Kindness</h2><p><br><br><p>Kindness is the foundation of the world&#x2019;s great religions and most-enduring philosophies. Why, then, does being kind feel so dangerous? If we crave kindness with such intensity, why is it a pleasure we often deny ourselves?

Media gurus lament the selfishness of our times, while newspapers regularly feature stories like the one about a wealthy stockbroker who, at the peak of his career, decided tospend his weekends doing volunteer work with deprived children. He was amazed at his own reaction. "Helping kids just makes me so happy, I feel like a different person." His astonishment is echoed in headline reports of studies of "what makes people happy," which show kindness registering much higher on the happiness scale than self-focused behavior. A recent report described an experiment carried out by the American psychologist Martin Seligman (author of Authentic Happiness), who recruited a group of university students to test out "philanthropy versus fun." "Guess which one gave them the bigger kick?" the reporter chortled. "I&#x2019;ve felt that kick too, every time I buy someone a pint." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Reading these stories, we began to wonder why people today are so surprised by the blindingly obvious. Why do the pleasuresof kindness astonish us? And why are stories about kindness often so corny or silly, so trivializing of the things that matter most to most people? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The pleasures of kindness were well known in the past. Kindness was mankind &#x2019;s "greatest delight," the Roman philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius declared, and thinkers and writers have echoed him down the centuries. But today, many peoplefind these pleasures literally incredible or at least highly suspect. An image of the self has been created that is utterlylacking in natural generosity. Most people appear to believe that deep down they (and other people) are mad, bad, and dangerous to know; that as a species&#x2014; apparently unlike other species of animal&#x2014;we are deeply and fundamentally antagonistic to each other, that our motives are utterly self-seeking, and that our sympathies are forms of self-protection. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>This book explains how and why this has come about. It shows how the kind life&#x2014;the life lived in instinctive sympathetic identification with the vulnerabilities and attractions of others&#x2014;is the life we are more inclined to live, and indeed is the one we are often living without letting ourselves know that this is what we are doing. People are leading secretly kind lives all the time but without a language in which to express this, or cultural support for it. Living according to our sympathies, we imagine, will weaken or overwhelm us; kindness is the saboteur of the successful life. We need to know how we have come to believe that the best lives we can lead seem to involve sacrificing the best things about ourselves; and how we have come to believe that there are pleasures greater than kindness. Kindness, we will argue in this book&#x2014;not sexuality, not violence, not money&#x2014;has become our forbidden pleasure. What is it about our times that makes kindness seem so dangerous? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In one sense kindness is always hazardous because it is based on a susceptibility to others, a capacity to identify with their pleasures and sufferings. Putting oneself in someone else &#x2019;s shoes, as the saying goes, can be very uncomfortable. But if the pleasures of kindness&#x2014;like all the greatest human pleasures&#x2014;are inherently perilous, they are nonetheless some of the most satisfying we possess. How have we come to repudiate them? In 1741 the Scottish philosopher David Hume, confronted by a school of philosophy that held mankind to be irredeemably selfish, lost patience. Any person foolish enoughto deny the existence of human kindness had simply lost touch with emotional reality, Hume insisted: "he has forgotten the movements of his heart." How do people come to forget about kindness and the deep pleasures it gives to them? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>On Kindness seeks to answer this question. Written by a historian and a psychoanalyst, it reveals the cost and, froma historical point of view, the peculiarity of modern attitudes to kindness. For nearly all of human history&#x2014;up to and beyond David Hume &#x2019;s day, the so-called dawn of modernity&#x2014; people have perceived themselves as naturally kind. Thisbook shows when and why this confidence evaporated and the consequences of this transformation: how in giving up on kindness&#x2014;and especially our own acts of kindness&#x2014;we deprive ourselves of a pleasure that is fundamental to our sense of well-being. "We mutually belong to one another," the philosopher Alan Ryan writes, and the good life is one "that reflects this truth." Today this truth has gone underground. Independence and self-reliance are now the great aspirations; "mutual belonging" is feared and unspoken; it has become one of the great taboos of our society. Why? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>To answer this we begin by looking back at ideas about kindness from the classical age onward. Kindness&#x2019;s original meaning of kinship or sameness has stretched over time to encompass sentiments that today go by a wide variety of names&#x2014;sympathy, generosity, altruism, benevolence, humanity, compassion, pity, empathy&#x2014;and that in the past were known by other terms as well, notably philanthropia (love of mankind) and caritas (neighborly or brotherly love). The precise meanings of these words vary, but fundamentally they all denote what the Victorians called "open-heartedness," the sympathetic expansiveness linking self to other. "No less indiscriminate and general than the alienation between people is the desire to breach it," the German critic Theodor Adorno once wrote, suggesting that even though our alienation, our distance from other people, may make us feel safe, it also makes us sorry, as though loneliness is the inevitable cost of looking after ourselves. History shows us the manifold expressions of humanity&#x2019;s desire to connect, from classical celebrations of friendship, to Christian teachings on love and charity, to twentieth-century philosophies of social welfare. It also shows us the degree of human alienation, how our capacity to care for each other is inhibited by fears and rivalrieswith a pedigree as long as kindness itself. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>For most of Western history the dominant tradition of kindness has been Christianity, which sacralizes people &#x2019;s generous instincts and makes them the basis of a universalist faith. For centuries, Christian caritas functioned as a culturalcement, binding individuals into society. But from the sixteenth century, the Christian rule "love thy neighbor as thyself " came under increasing attack from competitive individualism. Thomas Hobbes&#x2019;s Leviathan (1651)&#x2014;the urtext of the new individualism&#x2014;dismissed Christian kindness as a psychological absurdity. Men, Hobbes insisted, were selfish beasts who cared for nothing but their own well-being; human existence was a "warre of alle against alle." His arguments were slow to gain ground, but by the end of the eighteenth century&#x2014; despite the best efforts of David Hume and others&#x2014;they were becoming orthodoxy. Two centuries later it seems we are all Hobbesians, convinced that self-interest is our ruling principle. (The French psychoanalyst Lacan suggested that the Christian injunction "love thy neighbor as thyself " must be ironic, because people hate themselves.) Kindly behavior is looked upon with suspicion; public espousals of kindness are dismissed as moralistic and sentimental. "It&#x2019;s just human nature," we say of selfish behavior; what more can we expect? Kindness is seen either as a cover story or as a failure of nerve. Popular icons of kindness&#x2014;Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa&#x2014;are either worshipped as saints or gleefully unmasked as self-serving hypocrites. Prioritizing the needs of others may be praiseworthy, we think, but it is certainly not normal. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>So is it time to give up on being kind? Or at least to drop kindness as one of the things we claim to value, and instead just enjoy the apparently spontaneous but fleeting moments of kindness in our lives while acknowledging that, for selfish creatures like ourselves, these moments are the exceptions that prove the rule? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Today it is only between parents and children that kindness is expected, sanctioned, and indeed obligatory. But before we condemn the mother who rages at her toddler in the street, we might stop to consider what it feels like to be a parent in a society where kindness is incidentally praised while being implicitly discouraged. Kindness&#x2014;that is, the ability to bear the vulnerability of others, and therefore of oneself&#x2014; has become a sign of weakness (except of course among saintly people, in whom it is a sign of their exceptionality). No one yet says parents should stop being kind to their children. Nonetheless we have become phobic of kindness in our societies, avoiding obvious acts of kindness and producing, as we dowith phobias, endless rationalizations to justify our avoidance. All compassion is self-pity, D. H. Lawrence remarked, and this usefully formulates the widespread modern suspicion of kindness: that it is either a higher form of selfishness (the kind that is morally triumphant and secretly exploitative) or the lowest form of weakness (kindness is the way the weak control the strong, the kind are only kind because they haven&#x2019;t got the guts to be anything else). If we think of humans as essentially competitive, and therefore triumphalist by inclination, as we are encouraged to do, then kindness looks distinctlyold-fashioned, indeed nostalgic, a vestige from a time when we could recognize ourselves in each other and feel sympatheticbecause of our kindness&#x2014;if such a time ever existed.

In others we meet the man who accidentally summons a devil and then has to find a way of getting rid of him without losing his immortal soul, as well as the woman who, thanks to an experiment in time, discovers why her lover abandoned her. &#39;Wyndham writes strongly and has a gift for bizarre plots&#39; Guardian &#39;One of the few authors whose compulsive readability is a compliment to the intelligence&#39; Spectator John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Benyon Harris was born in 1903, the son of a barrister. He tried a number of careers including farming, law, commercial art and advertising, and started writing short stories, intended for sale, in 1925. From 1930 to 1939 he wrote short stories of various kinds under different names, almost exclusively for American publications, while also writing detective novels. During the war he was in the Civil Service and then the Army. In 1946 he went back to writing stories for publication in the USA and decided to try a modified form of science fiction, a form he called &#39;logical fantasy&#39;. As John Wyndham he wrote The Day of the Triffids, The Kraken Wakes, The Chrysalids, The Midwich Cuckoos (filmed as Village of the Damned), The Seeds of Time, Trouble with Lichen, The Outward Urge, Consider Her Ways and Others, Web and Chocky.

The answers to these questions reside in the pages of this book</p><p></p><h2>English Journeys Some Country Houses and Their Owners</h2><p>The delightful, gossipy diaries of James Lees-Milne describe his encounters with the owners of country houses - from eccentric lords and oil millionaires to raffish socialists - as he travelled over England saving properties for the National Trust. Here are sharply observed accounts of dinner with Vita Sackville-West at Sissinghurst; Winston Churchill&#39;s bedroom at Chartwell; T. E. Lawrence&#39;s dilapidated Dorset cottage; and war damage to a great house in Derby. All are infused with his love of beauty and his sympathy for those giving up their ancestral homes forever. Generations of inhabitants have helped shape the English countryside - but it has profoundly shaped us too.It has provoked a huge variety of responses from artists, writers, musicians and people who live and work on the land - as well as those who are travelling through it.English Journeys celebrates this long tradition with a series of twenty books on all aspects of the countryside, from stargazey pie and country churches, to man&#39;s relationship with nature and songs celebrating the patterns of the countryside (as well as ghosts and love-struck soldiers).</p><p>James Lees-Milne (1908-97) made his name as the National Trust&#39;s country house expert, helping to rescue some of England&#39;s loveliest houses. He is now best known for his diaries, published in the 1970s and hailed as a masterpiece comparable to Pepys.</p><h2>Silent Spring</h2><p>Now recognized as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century, &#34;Silent Spring&#34; exposed the destruction of wildlife through the widespread use of pesticides. Despite condemnation in the press and heavy-handed attempts by the chemical industry to ban the book, Rachel Carson succeeded in creating a new public awareness of the environment which led to changes in government and inspired the ecological movement.</p><p><i>Silent Spring</i>, released in 1962, offered the first shattering look at widespread ecological degradation and touched off an environmental awareness that still exists. Rachel Carson's book focused on the poisons from insecticides, weed killers, and other common products as well as the use of sprays in agriculture, a practice that led to dangerous chemicals to the food source. Carson argued that those chemicals were more dangerous than radiation and that for the first time in history, humans were exposed to chemicals that stayed in their systems from birth to death. Presented with thorough documentation, the book opened more than a few eyes about the dangers of the modern world and stands today as a landmark work.Rachel Carson (1907&#x2013;1964) spent most of her professional life as a marine biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. By the late 1950s, she had written three lyrical, popular books about the sea, including the best-selling The Sea Around Us, and had become the most respected science writer in America. She completed Silent Spring against formidable personal odds, and with it shaped a powerful social movement that has altered the course of history.</p><h2>The Clue in the Crystal Ball (Clue, Book 17)</h2><p>Another wacky collection of mini-mysteries challenges young Clue fans to test their sleuthing skills to figure out if Mrs. White, Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, or another of the gang did in the ever-present Mr. Boddy.

(Dr Seuss)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. The story of Peter T. Hooper&#39;s search for different, exciting eggs and his new recipe for scrambled eggs</p><p>Starring the same perky boy who captured Thing One and Thing Two in <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>, this is a first-person tall tale about cooking. Peter T. Hooper is bored to bits by his mother's habit of always making scrambled eggs out of hen's eggs. "And so," he informs his friend Liz, "I decided that, just for a change, I'd scramble a new kind of egg on the range." We're off on an epic journey to parts (and birds) unknown, all told in classic head-over-heels Seussian style: "Then I went for some Ziffs. They're exactly like Zuffs. But the Ziffs live on cliffs and the Zuffs live on bluffs." Finally, after capturing a small mountain of different types of egg--from Moth-Watching Sneths, Long-Legger Kwongs, and others--it's back to the kitchen for a 99-pan scramble, with all sorts of bizarre ingredients added just for fun. To be precise, it's time for "Scrambled eggs Super-Dee-Dooper-Dee-Booper, Special deluxe a-la-Peter T. Hooper." Somehow, you get the impression that Liz doesn't believe a word of it.

Neuman published over forty years</p><p></p><h2>Acts of Worship: Seven Stories</h2><p>Part autobiography and part reflection, this document describes the tortuous path Yukio Mishima took from introverted child to acclaimed novelist and playwright, and self-proclaimed conscience of post-war Japan.</p><p>Yukio Mishima, one of the most spectacularly gifted writers in modern Japan, was born into a samurai family in 1925. He attended the Peers' School and Tokyo Imperial University, and for a time worked at the Ministry of Finance. His first full length novel, Confessions of a Mask, appeared in 1949, and since then he published over a dozen novels, almost all of which were translated into English and other languages during his.lifetime. They include: Thirst for Love; Forbidden Colors; Death in Midsummer; The Sound of Waves; The Temple of the Golden Pavilion; After the Banquet; The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea; and Spring Snow. <p>Mishima's reverence for the Japanese martial arts led him to take up Kendo (a type of fencing, with wooden swords) and Karate, as well as body-building, and by 1968 he had become a Kendo master of the fifth dan. He also organized a "private army" called the Shield Society, and in November 1970 he and his group forced their way into a Self-Defense Force headquarters in Tokyo, where Mishima, after reading out a proclamation, committed ritual suicide with a young follower in the commanding officer's room. On the morning of his death, the last volume of Mishima's tetralogy, The Sea of Fertility ( The Spring Snow, Runaway Horses, The Temple of Dawn, The Decay of the Angel) was delivered to his publisher. </p><p>He is survived by his wife and two children. </p><p>The Translator: John Bester, born and educated in England, is one of the foremost translators of Japanese fiction. Among his translations are Masuji Ibuse's Black Rain, Kenzaburo Oe's The Silent Cry, Fumiko Enchi's The Waiting Years, Junnosuke Yoshiyuki's The Dark Room, and Mishima's autobiographical Sun and Steel. He received the 1990 Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature (for Acts of Worship).</p>The grove behind the pigeon lofts was a sunny patch of widely spaced trees, little frequented, where the pigeons often came to pass the time. An undistinguished collection of smallish deciduous trees, it had, at its very center, one great pine with gently outstretched branches on which the birds were fond of lining up to coo at one another. The rays of the afternoon sun picked out the trunk of the pine in a bright, pure light so that the resin flowing from it looked like veins of agate. <p>Hatakeyama came to a halt and said to the boy holding the rope: </p><p>"All right--this'll do. Take the rope off Watari. But don't let him get away. Throw the thing up like a lasso and put it over that big branch on the pine tree." </p><p>The rich jest of this sent the others into ecstasies. Watari was being held down by two of them. The remaining four danced like little demons on the grass as they helped hitch up the rope. One end of it was tied in a loop. Then one of the boys mounted a handy tree stump, poked his head through the noose, and stuck out his tongue. </p><p>"That's no good--it'll have to be higher." </p><p>The boy who'd stuck his tongue out was the shortest of them all. Watari would need at least another two or three inches. </p><p>They were all scared, scared by the occasional shadowy suggestion that their prank might possibly be in earnest. As they led Watari, pale and trembling slightly, to the waiting noose, one waggish youth delivered a funeral address. All the while, Watari continued to gaze up at the sky with his idiotically wide-open eyes. </p><p>Abruptly, Hatakeyama raised a hand by way of a signal. His eyes were shut tight. </p><p>The rope went up. </p><p>Startled by the sudden beating of many pigeons' wings and by the glow on Watari's beautiful face, astonishingly high above them, they fled the grove, each in a different direction, unable to bear the thought of staying at the scene of such dire murder. </p><p>They ran at a lively pace, each boyish breast still swelling with the pride of having killed someone. </p><p>A full thirty minutes later, they reentered the wood as though by agreement and, huddling together, gazed up fearfully at the branch of the great pine. </p><p>The rope was dangling free, the hanged corpse nowhere to be seen.</p></p><h2>Illustrated Light on Yoga: An Easy-to-follow Version of the Classic Introduction to Yoga</h2><p>This is a straightforward and comprehensive introduction for the beginner by the acknowledged expert on the subject.

In addition to collecting all of Morley&#x2019;s classic works about the band, the book includes his eloquent Ian Curtis obituary and hindsight pieces on the group&#x2019;s significance, framed by an extensive retrospective essay, as well as his reviews of the films <i>24 Hour Party People</i> and <i>Control.</i> Morley, who emerged from Manchester at the same time as Joy Division, effortlessly evokes that city&#x2019;s zeitgeist and psycho-geography to tell the story of this uniquely intense group.</p><p><b>Paul Morley</b> wrote for the <i>NME</i> from 1977 to 1983 when the magazine was at its most successful and notorious.

Lovecraft and his circle.</b><br><br>Marina Willett, M.D., has a problem. Her husband, Charlie, has become obsessed with H.P. Lovecraft, in particular with one episode in the legendary horror writer's life: In the summer of 1934, the "old gent" lived for two months with a gay teenage fan named Robert Barlow, at Barlow's family home in central Florida. What were the two of them up to? Were they friends--or something more? Just when Charlie thinks he's solved the puzzle, a new scandal erupts, and he disappears. The police say it's suicide. Marina is a psychiatrist, and she doesn't believe them.<br><br>A tour-de-force of storytelling, <i>The Night Ocean</i> follows the lives of some extraordinary people: Lovecraft, the most influential American horror writer of the 20th century, whose stories continue to win new acolytes, even as his racist views provoke new critics; Barlow, a seminal scholar of Mexican culture who killed himself after being blackmailed for his homosexuality (and who collaborated with Lovecraft on the beautiful story "The Night Ocean"); his student, future Beat writer William S. Burroughs; and L.C. Spinks, a kindly Canadian appliance salesman and science-fiction fan -- the only person who knows the origins of <i>The Erotonomicon</i>, purported to be the intimate diary of Lovecraft himself.<br><br>As a heartbroken Marina follows her missing husband's trail in an attempt to learn the truth, the novel moves across the decades and along the length of the continent, from a remote Ontario town, through New York and Florida to Mexico City. <i>The Night Ocean</i> is about love and deception -- about the way that stories earn our trust, and betray it.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2017:</strong> I&#x2019;ve never been mesmerized by horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, but I was immediately spellbound by <em>The Night Ocean</em>, a novel that is, on the surface, about Lovecraft&#x2019;s secrets but reveals far more about the dark power of stories on our belief in reality. As the book opens, the narrator&#x2019;s husband has apparently committed suicide by drowning himself in a remote lake in the middle of winter. But the body has not yet been found, and Charlie&#x2019;s suicide note quotes that of Lovecraft&#x2019;s supposed lover, a man who either killed himself or deliberately vanished in Mexico City a half century before. As Mar, a psychiatrist, waits for the icy waters to warm and relax its grip on Charlie&#x2019;s body, she retraces her husband&#x2019;s investigation into the murky details of Lovecraft&#x2019;s life, immersing herself in the long-buried truths&#x2014;or lies, or something greater than truths or lies&#x2014;about Lovecraft and his young prot�g�, Robert Barlow. Bit by bit, terse details escape about Mar&#x2019;s fraying marriage and her husband&#x2019;s Lovecraft obsession. In counterpoint, she offers full-color accounts of Lovecraft&#x2019;s affair with Barlow and Barlow&#x2019;s years in Mexico City. Stories bloom within stories, and soon, like Mar&#x2019;s husband, you&#x2019;ll find yourself unable to find the horizon between fact and fiction. Weird, unsettling in its acuity, and beautifully written, La Farge&#x2019;s novel sways between an homage to fantastical fiction and an unwrapping of our too-human desires. <em>--Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em>Paul La Farge is the author of the novels The Artist of the Missing (1999), <i>Haussmann, or the Distinction</i> (2001), and <i>Luminous Airplanes </i>(2011), as well as <i>The Facts of Winter</i> (2005), a book of imaginary dreams.

Thirty-two years before it was made into a movie, <i>Harriet the Spy</i> was a groundbreaking book: its unflinchingly honest portrayal of childhood problems and emotions changed children's literature forever. Happily, it has neither dated nor become obsolete and remains one of the best children's novels ever written. The fascinating story is about an intensely curious and intelligent girl, who literally spies on people and writes about them in her secret notebook, trying to make sense of life's absurdities. When her classmates find her notebook and read her painfully blunt comments about them, Harriet finds herself a lonely outcast. Fitzhugh's writing is astonishingly vivid, real and engaging, and Harriet, by no means a typical, loveable heroine, is one of literature's most unforgettable characters. <i>School Library Journal</i> wrote, "a tour de force... bursts with life." The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books called it "a very, very funny story." And <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> raved, "brilliantly written... a superb portrait of an extraordinary child."Harriet M. Welsch is a spy. In her notebook, she writes down everything she knows about everyone, even her classmates and her best friends. Then Harriet loses track of her notebook, and it ends up in the wrong hands. Before she can stop them, her friends have read the always truthful, sometimes awful things she&#39;s written about each of them. Will Harriet find a way to put her life and her friendships back together?</p><h2>The Art of Tracey Emin</h2><p>The career of Tracey Emin, one of the best-known contemporary British artists, has become a potent symbol of the relationship between art and celebrity in our time. When it was exhibited in London at the Tate in 1999, her now notorious installation "My Bed" was denounced by conservative critics as a national scandal, but this and her other work have continued to attract ever larger audiences. Whether storming drunkenly out of live television debates, talking tearfully about her abortions, or modeling evening gowns for Vivienne Westwood, Tracey Emin makes headlines. <p>Yet if Emin is now universally recognized as a media phenomenon, her work has also begun to attract serious critical attention. In <i>The Art of Tracey Emin</i>, distinguished critics from Britain and the United States address her achievement in depth for the first time, tracing Emin's influences from Egon Schiele to Judy Chicago and establishing her place in a larger tradition of postmodern and feminist art. Adopting a variety of critical approaches, contributors explore the full range of Emin's work, from photography and monoprints to installation art and videos, showing that, however raw and personal it may seem to be, it actually represents a carefully meditated response to vital issues in contemporary culture and society. 50 illustrations.</p></p><p><b>Mandy Merck</b> is Professor of Media Arts at Royal Holloway, University of London.

For centuries, the general view had been that science is neither good nor bad&#x2014;that it merely supplies information and that new information is always beneficial. Now, science is viewed as a political constituency that isn&#x2019;t always in our best interest. We live in a world where the leaders of African nations prefer to let their citizens starve to death rather than import genetically modified grains. Childhood vaccines have proven to be the most effective public health measure in history, yet people march on Washington to protest their use. In the United States a growing series of studies show that dietary supplements and &#x201c;natural&#x201d; cures have almost no value, and often cause harm. We still spend billions of dollars on them. In hundreds of the best universities in the world, laboratories are anonymous, unmarked, and surrounded by platoons of security guards&#x2014;such is the opposition to any research that includes experiments with animals. And pharmaceutical companies that just forty years ago were perhaps the most visible symbol of our remarkable advance against disease have increasingly been seen as callous corporations propelled solely by avarice and greed.<br><br> As Michael Specter sees it, this amounts to a war against <i>progress</i>. The issues may be complex but the choices are not: Are we going to continue to embrace new technologies, along with acknowledging their limitations and threats, or are we ready to slink back into an era of magical thinking? In <i>Denialism</i>, Specter makes an argument for a new Enlightenment, the revival of an approach to the physical world that was stunningly effective for hundreds of years: What can be understood and reliably repeated by experiment is what nature regarded as true. Now, at the time of mankind&#x2019;s greatest scientific advances&#x2014;and our greatest need for them&#x2014;that deal must be renewed.</p><p>Michael Specter writes about science, technology and global public health for the <i>New Yorker</i>, where he has been a staff writer since 1998. He has twice received the Global Health Council&#x2019;s Excellence in Media Award, as well as the Science Journalism Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&#x201c;Specter is both provocative and thoughtful in his defense of science and rationality&#x2014;though he certainly does not believe that scientists are infallible. His writing is engaging and his sources are credible, making this a significant addition to public discourse on the importance of discriminating between credible science and snake oil.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><p>&#x201c;A lucid and insightful book about a very frightening and irrational phenomenon&#x2014;the fear and superstition that threaten human science and progress.

But Michael Specter very valuably gathers them under one roof and gives them a name. Specter describes the increasing public willingness to deny the hard-won facts of science in favor of myths and shoddy investigation.

A chef. An interior decorator. A landscape architect, as well as a gardener. I&#x2019;ve been a painter. A furniture restorer. A personal shopper. A veterinarian&#x2019;s assistant and sometimes the veterinarian.... An accountant, a banker, and on occasion, a broker. I&#x2019;ve been a beautician. A map. A psychic. Santa Claus. The Tooth Fairy.

But I do mind."</b> <p>Since Terry McMillan&#x2019;s breakout novel <b>Waiting to Exhale</b> surged onto the bestseller lists, critics and readers alike have been captivated by her irreverent, hilarious, pitch-perfect tales of women&#x2019;s lives and contemporary issues. With <b>The Interruption of Everything</b>, her sixth novel, McMillan takes on the fault lines of midlife and family life, reminds us once again of the redeeming power of friendship, and turns her eye toward the dilemma of how a woman starts to put her own needs higher on the to-do list while not shortchanging everyone else.</p><p>Marilyn Grimes, wife and mother of three, has made a career of deferring her dreams to build a suburban California home and lifestyle with her husband, Leon. She troubleshoots for her grown kids, cares for her live-in mother-in-law, Arthurine (and elderly poodle, Snuffy); keeps tabs on her girlfriends Paulette and Bunny and her own aging mother and foster sister&#x2014;all the while holding down a part-time job. But at forty-four, Marilyn&#x2019;s got too much on her plate and nothing to feed her passion. She feels like she&#x2019;s about ready to jump. She&#x2019;s just not sure where.</p><p>Highly entertaining, deeply human, a page-turner full of heart and soul, <b>The Interruption of Everything</b> is vintage Terry McMillan&#x2014;and a triumphant testament to the fact that the detour is the path, and living life "by the numbers" never quite adds up.</p></p><p>Terry McMillan's sixth novel, <i>The Interruption of Everything</i>, is every bit as enthralling and empowering as her earlier hits <i>Waiting to Exhale</i> and <i>A Day Late and a Dollar Short</i>. However, as McMillan matures as an author, her characters follow suit, which leads her to a wiser, more introspective lead character in the form of Marilyn Grimes. Our reward, as readers, is a tale of midlife crisis, mixed with family and personal drama, all told in the witty, honest, and inspiring style we've come to expect from this seasoned storyteller.<p> As Marilyn approaches middle-age, we follow her struggle to discover herself outside the constraints of a passionless marriage, a demanding family and an ever-growing list of dreams deferred. With three children in college, a husband who suffers from destructive professional and personal inertia, a demanding mother-in-law, a senile mother and a drug-addicted sister, Marilyn has more on her plate than she expected at this stage of the game. Torn between taking care of her friends and family and attending to her own needs, she's faced with choices, like deciding to finish her graduate degree, that never before seemed hers to make. Along the way, supporting characters like Marilyn's feisty little niece and supportive-yet-opinionated best friends Paulette and Bunny add humor and depth to our heroine's character. And as always, McMillan does a flawless job of incorporating humor into even the most traumatic situations, as evidenced by a scene in which Marilyn ends up babysitting her hairdresser's children while waiting twelve hours for new braids. ("At three, Blue has to make a run. Orange has to go to the bank to get a money order. I ask Lexus to find me a Pamper and I take the baby in the bathroom.")</p><p> Warm and witty, sincere and heartfelt, <i>The Interruption of Everything</i> is sure to delight McMillan devotees and attract a host of new fans. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>Terry McMillan is the critically acclaimed, award-winning author of five previous novels and recipient of the Essence Award for Excellence in Literature.<br><br><p> </p><p> </p></p><h2>A Quilter&#39;s Christmas (Rodale Quilt Book)</h2><p>Provides diagrams and instructions for making quilts, wall hangings, tree skirts, place mats, ornaments, and decorations, and includes a variety of quilt patterns</p><p></p><h2>101 Granny Squares: New Motifs For Contemporary Designs</h2><p>Welcome to the wonderful world of granny squares!

This is the often-overlooked story of how alcohol has shaped American events and the American character from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. <br><br>Seen through the lens of alcoholism, American history takes on a vibrancy and a tragedy missing from many earlier accounts. From the drunkenness of the Pilgrims to Prohibition hijinks, drinking has always been a cherished American custom: a way to celebrate and a way to grieve and a way to take the edge off. At many pivotal points in our history-the illegal <i>Mayflower</i> landing at Cape Cod, the enslavement of African Americans, the McCarthy witch hunts, and the Kennedy assassination, to name only a few-alcohol has acted as a catalyst.<br><br>Some nations drink more than we do, some drink less, but no other nation has been the drunkest in the world as America was in the 1830s only to outlaw drinking entirely a hundred years later. Both a lively history and an unflinching cultural investigation, DRINKING IN AMERICA unveils the volatile ambivalence within one nation's tumultuous affair with alcohol. <br><br></p><p>Susan Cheever is the author of the biographies <i>E.E. Cummings</i>, <i>American Bloomsbury</i>, and <i>My Name Is Bill</i>, as well as five novels and four memoirs. Her work has appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>New York Times</i>, and <i>Newsday</i>, among other magazines and anthologies. She has been a Guggenheim Fellow, has been nominated for a National Book Circle Award, and won the <i>Boston Globe</i> Winship medal. She attended Brown University and has taught at many places, including Yale, Brown, Columbia, the New School, and Bennington College."A fascinating look at the place and function of alcohol throughout American history...[Cheever] offers a colorful portrait of a society that, like her own family, has been indelibly shaped by its drinking habits. An intelligently argued study of our country's 'passionate connection to drinking.'"&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></i></b><br><br>"Susan Cheever offers a humane but unsentimental view of our nation's inebriated past in DRINKING IN AMERICA. To excuse the pun, it's an addictive read full of wit and verve, revealing the deep influence of alcohol on many of our country's most significant moments, from the landing at Plymouth Harbour, to the Kennedy Assassination and Watergate. This is terrific social history but not as it's usually told, and all the better for it."&#x2015;<b><i>Amanda Foreman, author of <i>Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire</i> (winner of the Whitbread) and <i>A World on Fire: Britain's Crucial Role in the American Civil War</i></i></b><br><br>"Cheever's central observation is fascinating...The melting pot, it seems, was also a mixing bowl."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>"Insightful...well-researched and well-developed...An engrossing, in-depth examination of the profound ways alcohol and drinking have shaped and contributed to American history."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Shelf Awareness</em></i></b><br><br>"Cheever is full of such shocking and often delightful revelations of a history we never learned in school."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Newsday</em></i></b><br><br>"I can't stop raving (soberly!) about Susan Cheever's new book... It is both enlightening and frightening. A brilliant and important addition to our understanding of what goes wrong and what can continue to go wrong in a world dominated by the most deadly legal liquid ever invented."&#x2015;<b><i>Judy Collins</i></b><br><br>"Compelling...[a] brisk drinker's companion to US history, which runs a black light over the archives to ask: who was loaded, and why did it matter?... It's the fourth of Wilson's famous 12 steps that made it common practice for sober folk to dig into their own pasts in order to articulate the role of alcohol - to create a 'searching and fearless moral inventory' - and with DRINKING IN AMERICA, Cheever submits the US to a similar investigation. Along the way, we see a country struggling to negotiate its freedoms, nurtured by alcohol and undone by it as well....This approach can be illuminating, turning those sepia-toned historical figures in wigs into uncertain young men with tankards of rum in their hands."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em></i></b><br><br>"Cheever serves up a sober cocktail of American history...offers up sideways views that are intriguing."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Associated Press</em></i></b><br><br>"Full of compelling ideas...Cheever is smart, perceptive and disciplined...Her Nixon chapter in particular is alternately horrifying and delightful, and paints a compelling picture of the monstrous complexity of a 'great man.'"&#x2015;<b><i><em>Buffalo News</em></i></b><br><br>"Vivid...some of the book's most affecting moments arrive when Cheever discusses her family's drinking problems.

When it declared war, the United States was the youngest of the major powers and militarily the weakest by far. On November 11, 1918, when the fighting stopped, it was not only the richest country on earth but the mightiest.<br><br> With the mercurial, autocratic President Woodrow Wilson as a primary focus, G. J. Meyer takes readers from the heated deliberations over U.S. involvement, through the provocations and manipulations that drew us into the fight, to the battlefield itself and the shattering aftermath of the struggle. America&#x2019;s entry into the Great War helped make possible the defeat of Germany that had eluded Britain, France, Russia, and Italy in three and a half years of horrendous carnage. Victory, in turn, led to a peace treaty so ill-conceived, so vindictive, that the world was put on the road to an even bloodier confrontation a mere twenty years later.<br><br> On the home front, Meyer recounts the break-up of traditional class structures, the rise of the progressive and labor movements, the wave of anti-German hysteria, and the explosive expansion of both the economy and federal power, including shocking suspensions of constitutional protections that planted the seeds of today&#x2019;s national security state. Here also are revealing portraits of Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert La Follette, Eugene Debs, and John J. &#x201c;Black Jack&#x201d; Pershing, among others, as well as European leaders such as &#x201c;Welsh Wizard&#x201d; David Lloyd George of Britain, &#x201c;Tiger&#x201d; Georges Clemenceau of France, and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany.<br><br> Meyer interweaves the many strands of his story into a gripping narrative that casts new light on one of the darkest, most forgotten corners of U.S. history. In the grand tradition of his earlier work <i>A World Undone</i>&#x2014;which centered on the European perspective&#x2014;<i>The World Remade</i> adds a new, uniquely American dimension to our understanding of the seminal conflict of the twentieth century.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>The World Remade</i><br><br></b>&#x201c;[G.

After four dark, grim, clenched-�teeth Christmases spent under the shadow of the apocalypse, the City of Light was free again to be itself, ablaze with the celebration of life.<br><br>There was much to grieve, yes&#x2014;�a terrible burden of grief, the incomprehensible sum of something like nine million fighting men dead along with a like number of civilians, plus survivors beyond numbering too broken ever to be put together again. France had suffered as much as any country and more than most, the war having taken nearly 3.5 percent of her population, one of every four men between the ages of eighteen and thirty. But a dozen other nations were similarly bereaved. From Portugal to the Russian steppe, men were learning to live without a limb or all their limbs. And learning to live with the compulsive twitching and trembling that were among the mysterious symptoms of shell shock, a new kind of affliction the name of which reflected ignorance of its causes. Men without eyes were being taught to weave baskets.<br><br>But the worst was over. In western Europe at least, the bloodletting had stopped. There were no more enemy armies just beyond the horizon, pressing to break through. There was no need to fear that those enemies might soon be marching in triumph down the Champs-��lys�es. Such nightmare visions belonged to the past.<br><br>And upon this reborn Paris there now descended the man who had saved it, Thomas Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States. He arrived like a god, the first serving president ever to cross the Atlantic, borne on a great liner that, as it approached the port of Brest, passed through an honor guard of nine of his navy&#x2019;s battleships, twenty of its destroyers, and like numbers of French and British warships.<br><br>(That liner, by the way, was herself a symbol of conquest and of new beginnings. Christened the George Washington when launched by her German builders, she was the third largest passenger ship in the world and at the start of the war ranked as Germany&#x2019;s finest. She had happened to be in New York harbor when war broke out in August 1914, was unable to return home because Britain&#x2019;s Royal Navy controlled the North Atlantic, and was impounded when the United States declared war on Germany in 1917. She was in every way perfect for this glorious mission.)<br><br>The harbor at Brest overflowed with rapturous crowds as Wilson&#x2019;s ship approached her berth. Bands played, cannons boomed. And then that night, all along the route of the special train that carried the president and his wife and their entourage through cities and towns and country crossroads to Paris, people of every age and description came down to the tracks to see their deliverer go rumbling by. Some of them knelt, in attitudes of prayer.<br><br>It is said that two million people thronged the streets of the capital the morning of the president&#x2019;s arrival. Even those old enough to remember the pomp of Napoleon III&#x2019;s reign said it paled in comparison with this. The Gare de Luxembourg was turned into the world&#x2019;s biggest flower basket, strains of &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; filled the air, and crowds cheered and laughed and wept. The Tiger was there, of course: Prime Minister Georges Cle�menceau, an old man so combative, so rich in enemies, that he would never have been given the premiership if the only alternative had not appeared to be peace on Germany&#x2019;s terms. The man who, upon taking office, had declared that his only foreign policy was to make war and his only domestic policy was the same. His short, plump body, round bald pate, and fat white mustache were unmistakable to all who caught a glimpse of him. He was joined by a less striking figure, President Raymond Poincar�, taller and almost slender by comparison, elegantly goateed. The two despised each other and made no secret of it. They had come together not just to welcome the American but to bask in the glow of his glory.<br><br>The beaming Wilson, slim and dapper and handsome in a way both boyish and austere, rested and at ease after nine days on calm seas, was led to a horse-�drawn open carriage and joined there by Poincar�. The pert and pretty Edith Galt Wilson followed in a second carriage with Madame Poincar�. The two chiefs of state and their ladies formed the centerpiece of a grand procession. Led by a regiment of cavalry in full regalia, it made its slow way through the Place de la Concorde, past the statue representing the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine from which a black shroud had recently been removed to mark their recovery from Germany, up a Champs-��lys�es lined with captured German guns to the Arc de Triomphe. The carriages soon filled with thrown flowers. The multitudes roared as again and again Wilson raised his silk top hat.<br><br>Huge banners were everywhere. Vive Wilson, they declared. Vive l&#x2019;Am�rique. Wilson le Juste.<br><br>The Wilsons were delivered at last to the Murat Palace, which was to serve as their residence during the short time they expected to be in France. They were given a quick tour by its owner, Prince Joachim Napoleon Murat, descendant of one of Napoleon I&#x2019;s great marshals and the emperor&#x2019;s sister Caroline. In size the palace rivaled the White House, with more privacy thanks to the high walls surrounding its wide gardens and an infinitely more exquisite interior. Meanwhile the president&#x2019;s retinue, including the teams of scholars and experts who had been brought along to help him put the world right, was moving into the magnificent H�tel de Crillon, adjacent to the American embassy. Everything possible was being done to make them happy to be in Paris, to show them that they were among friends.<br><br>By early afternoon Wilson was settled in the splendid study adjacent to his equally splendid bedroom on the palace&#x2019;s upper floor. No one was with him except the only man he wanted with him, wily little Edward House, not only his closest confidant but nearly his alter ego. &#x201c;My second personality,&#x201d; Wilson called him, &#x201c;my independent self: his thoughts and mine are one.&#x201d; House had been in Europe since October, known to all as the president&#x2019;s personal representative, explaining his objectives and gathering information on his behalf. He called himself &#x201c;Colonel&#x201d; and expected to be addressed as such, although he had never served in any army. He said it was a geographic rather than a military title, having been conferred on him by a governor of his native Texas.<br><br>House and the president had much to discuss. First were the preparations for the peace conference that was soon to begin, and that had brought Wilson to Europe. House would have been eager to share the latest news about the leading participants&#x2014;�about who thought what, and what kinds of difficulties they were likely to create. Beyond that were all the grand plans that the two of them had spent months and even years perfecting for Europe and the world.<br><br>So there sat Wilson in regal splendor, once the obscure son of a southern preacher, now the idol of what was coming to be called the Free World, preparing to rescue the world&#x2019;s unfree portions. Still not sixty-�two years old, he was at the midpoint of his second term in office and entirely justified if he regarded himself as the most famous, most admired, most important human being on the planet.<br><br>And why not? There was nothing in such a claim to make Wilson wince. If he had always been ferociously ambitious, declaring as an undergraduate that youngsters like himself should &#x201c;acquire knowledge that we might have power,&#x201d; he had wanted power only in order to do good. So he told himself, at least. From his Parisian palace, he could look back on a career in which he had done much good, and not only after reaching the White House: as an educator, too, and as an author, governor of a major state, one of the master orators of his time, and leading figure in that irruption of American reformist zeal known as the Progressive Movement.<br><br>His whole life, but especially the past ten years, could be seen in retrospect as an arrow shot straight at this climactic moment. In the three astonishing years that ended with the election of 1912, he had vaulted from the presidency of Princeton University to the presidency of the United States. The war had then made him the man who, as Winston Churchill would write, &#x201c;played a part in the fate of nations incomparably more direct and personal than any other.&#x201d; Finally he had been brought here, to a Europe that (he saw ample reason to believe) needed him terribly. Could there be a more certain confirmation that he had been destined from eternity to do &#x201c;high-�minded things&#x201d;? That God had singled him out?<br><br>Again: why not? Not even his adversaries&#x2014;�which, being a supremely successful politician, he had in abundance&#x2014;�could have denied that he was brilliantly gifted, impeccably upright, and guided by high ideals. But of course he was also human, which is to say he was limited, and among his limitations was a blindness of a kind that is perhaps not all that unusual among extraordinary men of a certain type. Often right about important things, he was inclined to think himself always right about everything. He found it difficult&#x2014;�could find it impossible&#x2014;�to imagine that those who disagreed with him might sometimes be right. Might be acting in good faith, at least. Among his talents was the ability to deceive himself, about his own actions and motives above all, and then to deceive others while remaining certain of his own integrity. These were dangerous traits in the most important man on the planet, at a time when humanity stood on the brink of momentous decisions. Those who do not see what is real are generally doomed to collide with it.<br><br>In Paris five weeks after the end of the Great War, some things were being concealed from Wilson not only by his own blindness but by other people as well. He had no way of knowing how much, despite the extravagance of the welcome they had prepared for him, Clemenceau and Poincar� did not want him in France, or that England&#x2019;s prime minister, the &#x201c;Welsh Wizard&#x201d; David Lloyd George, likewise wished he had stayed home and hoped he would soon return there.<br><br>These men led nations that had barely survived fifty months of the most ruinous war in European history, had buried hundreds of thousands of their sons, and had impoverished themselves in carrying on the fight. America&#x2019;s troops, by contrast, had been in combat for barely six months, had operated as an independent army for a mere two months, and in the end had lost only half as many men as Romania or Serbia (never mind France or Britain, or Russia or Germany or Italy).<br><br>Against this background, it is understandable if Clemenceau and Lloyd George were inclined to find it not only ridiculous but offensive that an American should now come across the Atlantic for the purpose of showing them how to make peace. Both men had spent their lives in political combat, fighting their way from modest beginnings to the top of the greasy pole. Woodrow Wilson, by comparison, was little more than an amateur, a newcomer, a professional academic who had entered politics at an elevated level a mere eight years before and appeared to regard himself as teacher to the world. The Europeans were accustomed by now to his lofty preachments, and not particularly grateful for them.<br><br>Yes, victory would have been long delayed if not impossible without the contribution of the United States. America&#x2019;s vast wealth had come to the rescue just in time to save Britain and France from collapse. By pouring in food and war mat�riel and an endless flood of fresh troops, America had driven Germany to the desperate measures that hastened her collapse.<br><br>But still. . . . <br><br>It was difficult for America&#x2019;s &#x201c;associates&#x201d; (Wilson refused to call them allies, wanting to make clear that his country was operating on its own distinctly higher plane) not to see the president as presumptuous, absurd, perhaps even contemptible. Some of his ideas seemed not only foolish but intolerable. He wanted to guarantee freedom of the seas to all nations even in times of war; this made the British, whose great navy had saved them from starvation while starving their enemies, wonder what the point of that navy was supposed to be if another war came. Wilson also wanted a peace without reparations or retribution; for the French, who saw themselves as innocent victims of aggression and had been left with a wide swath of devastation that cut through their heartland like a bleeding wound from the Belgian border to the Swiss, this was outrageous. As for the League of Nations that Wilson envisaged as the centerpiece of his beautiful postwar world, the Italians may have been especially artful in feigning more enthusiasm for it than they felt, but they were far from alone in their skepticism.<br><br>But still . . . <br><br>America had been indispensable, and all the unsubtle hints from the French and the British had not sufficed to keep Wilson on his own side of the ocean. Now that he was in Paris, there was nothing to do but to make the best of it. If that meant pretending to be sympathetic to his seemingly numberless proposals, displaying the patience that one would extend to an ignorant and stubborn child, so be it. If it required trying inch by inch to expose him to the realities of postwar Europe, stalling for time while doing so, that was hardly the greatest challenge that his fellow victors had faced in recent months.<br><br>Where Wilson&#x2019;s blindness was most willful as 1918 ended was in the realm of domestic politics. Many of the Americans best qualified to judge&#x2014;�Secretary of State Robert Lansing, leading members of Congress from both parties, even Colonel House&#x2014;�had tried to dissuade him from going to Europe. After all, the transatlantic telegraph was now an established fact, so he could direct America&#x2019;s part in the peace conference from the White House. People with his best interests at heart argued that there was no need for him to become so directly involved in what could only be extremely difficult negotiations, thereby putting so much of his own political capital at stake. Some who were not so friendly complained that it was irresponsible for a president to put a wide ocean between himself and Washington.

She has even maintained a cordial relationship with her ex, charismatic broadcast journalist Eric Fortman, covering with the boys for his absences and broken promises. Luckily Travis Allen, her closest neighbor, has been a loving surrogate father to the boys and her own best friend.<br><br>Then, on the eve of oldest son Jared's graduation, Eric returns, having nearly lost his life in Afghanistan. Worse, he has lost his way and his courage, and needs a place to recover. Gayle realizes this might be the last chance for her sons to establish a real bond with their father, and offers him a summer at the inn and a chance to put things right. Gayle and Eric are all too aware that their onetime love and attraction are still there. But can the pieces of their broken lives be mended, or are they better laid to rest?<br><br></p><p>Emilie Richards&#x2019;s many novels feature complex characterizations and in-depth explorations of social issues. Both are a result of her training and experience as a family counselor, which contribute to her fascination with relationships of all kinds. Emilie and her husband enjoy dividing their time between the Florida Gulf Coast and Chautauqua County, New York. She is currently working on her next novel for MIRA Books.Gayle Fortman knew a number of things for certain, but three were at the top of her list. One, that life could spin out of control unless she spent all her waking hours nudging it into place. Two, that even sternly administered nudges couldn't deter fate. And three, that if fate could not be nudged, cajoled or outrun, the only other possibility was to turn and face it squarely. <p>But she didn't have to smile. </p><p>Gayle wasn't smiling now. This morning no one was nearby, so she had no reason to pretend she was anything but worried about what fate had in store for her. </p><p>Eric Fortman, the man to whom she'd been married for seven years and divorced from for twelve, was coming home. Eric, the father of three sons who, through the years, had seen him more frequently on their television screen than in person. Eric, her first and only love, who still managed to make the men who volunteered to take his place pale in comparison. </p><p>Eric, who had faced fate head-on, nearly died from the experience and was now in need of the family he had abandoned. </p><p>A lump formed in her throat at that thought, and she reached for the coffee mug she had set on a table at the terrace's edge, grateful as the steaming liquid dissolved this one lump of many that had resided there for the past weeks. </p><p>From an ash tree at the edge of the clearing, a bird trilled a sunrise serenade, untroubled at the lack of a larger audience. Maybe the bird, an old companion, understood one of the other things of which Gayle was certain. If she jumped out of bed in the mornings and hit the ground running, she would fall flat on her face. So every day, alone on the terrace that overlooked the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, she stood with a cup of coffee in her hands and watched as dawn's artistic fingers drizzled copper and platinum on the rippling water. </p><p>When midsummer's humidity, fueled by dewdrops and river mist, sucked the breath from her lungs, or when treacherous sheets of ice glazed the fieldstones she and Eric had so carefully laid, she stood here. Dawn was the time when she gathered her thoughts, murmured her prayers, dreamed her dreams. She wasn't rich or self-indulgent, but she gave herself these precious minutes of solitude before she headed into the kitchen of Daughter of the Stars, the bed-and-breakfast inn she owned and operated, to begin her day in earnest. </p><p>Except that this morning, with so much to sort out and prepare for, it seemed she wasn't alone after all. </p><p>Surprised, Gayle stepped forward and squinted into the pearly light. The inn sat high on a slope, protected from waters that rose and fell according to the whims of the river gods. But when the Shenandoah raged, the low water bridges that skated back and forth over the snaking length of it were quickly submerged. Gardens planted in the alluvial soil washed downstream, and <i>river </i>became a verb. Everyone within miles of the North Fork understood what it meant to be <i>rivered in. </i></p><p>The river was behaving this morning, but the same could not be said about a certain family member. Gayle slammed her coffee mug on the table, then she started down the terrace steps at a brisk trot. The only thing that kept her from yelling her youngest son's name was the knowledge that a shout this close to the house would wake her older ones. </p><p>"Dillon," she muttered under her breath. "Dillon Arthur Fortman." </p><p>The boy in the boat didn't hear her, nor had she intended for him to. He was oblivious to everything. What could he hear inside the shabby rowboat tethered to the willow that grew at the river's edge, except the singing of the current, the slapping of gentle waves against the sides of the boat? </p><p>As Gayle watched, Dillon flipped a fishing rod over his shoulder, then brought it forward, flicking his wrist to cast his line farther into the river. Despite her annoyance, she winced as the rod jerked and stuttered, and the line flopped just in front of him. She had seen her son practice this maneuver over and over, yet his movements were as awkward as if he had never held a rod. Dillon had neither the coordination nor confidence to make his cast a thing of beauty. And his thirteen-year-old body, which every day seemed to explode in new and frightening directions, was as daunting an obstacle as any she'd ever seen. </p><p>Now that she was almost to the water, the rowboat no longer looked like one of the toys her son had sailed across mud puddles as a toddler. Afraid she would startle him, she raised her voice just enough that he could hear her words. </p><p>"Dillon Fortman, what are you doing out here alone?" </p><p>He turned, and the boat wobbled alarmingly. In the early morning light his face looked pudgy and unformed, his eyes heavy-lidded. </p><p>"What are <i>you </i>doing here?" </p><p>She had too many sons to go on the defensive. Sometimes she thought it was a shame Dillon never had the chance to trap her the way his brothers had. </p><p>She reached the bank and slapped her hands on her hips for emphasis. "We have rules. One of them is that you don't go near the river alone." </p><p>"But I didn't make that rule. You made it. I didn't get to say a thing about it." </p><p>"That's right." She picked her way across uneven ground to the tree where the boat was tied. Wedging her index finger between loops of what was to give Dillon credit an expertly tied knot, she began to loosen it so she could pull him to shore. </p><p>"I'm fishing!" </p><p>"No, you <i>were </i>fishing. Now you're coming in." </p><p>"You ruin everything!" </p><p>She ignored him, resorting again to years of experience. She managed to untie the knot, although by the time she was able to pull the boat to shore, yesterday's manicure one of her few indulgences was a casualty. </p><p>"We'll go over the rules while you're my captive audience," she said as pleasantly as she could muster. "You don't come down here alone. You don't go out in the boat alone. And you don't disobey me, then try to make this my fault." </p><p>"Well, it <i>is </i>your fault, because it's a stupid rule!" </p><p>The boat was close enough to the riverbank now that he could jump out and did. She moved to the edge and handed him the rope, then stepped back so he could finish pulling the boat ashore. </p><p>"We can always discuss a rule," she said as he went through the motions, then retied the boat once it was out of the water. "But we don't discuss a rule when you're in the middle of breaking it." </p><p>"Like you have time to talk to me or anybody else!" </p><p>She waited. She was a busy woman busier than most, it was true but all her sons knew she would drop anything if they needed her. Dillon was no exception. When he didn't, couldn't, come up with anything else to add, she took pity on him. </p><p>"Is this about your dad coming for the summer?" </p><p>Dillon was as tall as she was. At five foot five, she'd had little hope of remaining taller than her boys.Their father was a strapping six foot one, broad shouldered and raw boned. Eighteen-year-old Jared, their oldest son, was nearly as tall as Eric. At sixteen, Noah was not yet six feet, although he still looked down at Gayle from a superior height. Dillon was already taller than either of his brothers had been at the same age. Gayle hoped he would grow to be the tallest. He needed some way in which he towered over the others. </p><p>For the moment Dillon was just tall enough to gaze straight into her eyes. She saw that his were mud-brown with anger. His forehead was crinkled, and he was breathing loudly through his nose, like a bull about to charge. </p><p>"It doesn't matter." He cut his hand through the air, narrowly missing her shoulder. </p><p>"Well, it does. I'd like to know what you're doing out here." She sighed and her voice dropped appreciably. "How was the fishing?"</p><p>"Do you see any fish?" </p><p>Sadly, she didn't. "A worm waster, huh?" </p><p>The forehead crinkles deepened."Just because I said something cute when I was three doesn't mean I have to hear about it the rest of my life." </p><p>"Personally &#x2018;worm waster' makes me smile, and these days I need all the smiles I can get." She took a risk, a calculated one, and put her arm around his shoulder for a quick squeeze. He did not pull away. </p><p>"Your dad likes fresh river bass," she said. </p><p>"Yeah." </p><p>There was nothing else to say. As she had suspected, her son had sneaked out in the darkness, before the fish were even fully awake, hoping he could go back to the house with a string of freshly caught bass or sunfish. He had braved a river he feared, a sport that bored him, the state's warnings about PCB and mercury contamination in fish caught in these waters, and, finally, his mother's wrath. All in search of Eric Fortman's elusive love. </p><p>"Your dad likes fresh bass, but he'd be sorry to lose you over pursuit of them," she said as they started back toward the house. </p><p>"I can swim." </p><p>Dillon <i>could </i>swim. A little. She had made certain that despite his debilitating fear of the water, he learned to keep himself afloat. But her youngest son was a long way from being a <i>swimmer. </i>When the water was rough he was given to panic, to hyperventilation and cramps and erratic splashing. If he fell into the river when no one was watching, if he thought he was being carried away by the current despite his efforts, it was possible he might panic and drown. </p><p>Dillon did not need a reminder. He knew. </p><p>"Your dad also likes chocolate-chip muffins," she said when they were halfway to the house. "And the state of Virginia doesn't dictate how many we can safely eat in a month. Want to help me make some?" </p><p>"It's not the same thing." </p><p>"True. Muffins taste better for breakfast." </p><p>"I just wanted to show him I can fish!" </p><p>"Maybe the two of you can fish together when your dad's feeling a little stronger." </p><p>"Do you think he'll want to?" </p><p>The question was a good one. None of them knew exactly what Eric would feel like doing this summer. Her ex-husband's life had been turned upside down. His health had suffered. In their brief phone calls he had tried to be the take-charge Eric she'd known and loved so long ago. But he had sounded like an actor playing that part, a bit player who had only managed to memorize the lines. ...</p></p><h2>Encyclopedia of Positive Questions, Vol. 1</h2><p>Encyclopedia of Positive Questions, Volume I has been replaced with Encyclopedia of Positive Questions, 2nd Edition, ISBN 9781933403120 or 1933403128.</p><p></p><h2>Hathapradipika with Commentary Yogaprakasika</h2><p>Lonavla Yoga Institute Hathapradipika With Commentary Yogaprakasika</p><p></p><h2>The Casual Observer,</h2><p>The Casual Observer simply turned up one day from Nowhere in Particular.

And Raymond Burr has always been (and always will be) in my mind's eye as I read the novels.

In 2010, the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, began illustrating its parking tickets with a series of calming yoga poses.<br> <br>The popularity of yoga arises not only because of its talent for undoing stress but because its traditions make an engaging counterpoint to modern life. It&#x2019;s unplugged and natural, old and centered&#x2014;a kind of anti-civilization pill that can neutralize the dissipating influence of the Internet and the flood of information we all face. Its ancient serenity offers a new kind of solace.<br> <br>An indication of yoga&#x2019;s social ascendency is how its large centers often get housed in former churches, monasteries, and seminaries, the settings frequently rural and inspirational. Kripalu, on more than three hundred rolling acres of the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, was once a Jesuit seminary. Each year its yoga school graduates hundreds of new teachers. And they in turn produce thousands of new yogis and yoginis, or female yogis.<br> <br>Even the White House is into yoga. Michelle Obama made it part of Let&#x2019;s Move&#x2014;her national program of exercise for children, which seeks to fight obesity. The First Lady talks about yoga on school visits and highlights the discipline at the annual Easter Egg Roll, the largest public event on the White House social calendar. Starting in 2009, the egg roll has repeatedly featured a Yoga Garden with colorful mats and helpful teachers. The sessions start early and go throughout the day.<br> <br>On the White House lawn in 2010, an adult dressed as the Cat in the Hat&#x2014;a character from the Dr. Seuss book&#x2014;did a standing posture on one leg. A tougher demonstration featured five yogis simultaneously upending themselves in Headstands. At the 2011 event, the Easter Bunny did a tricky balancing pose. The children watched, played along, and took home a clear message about what the President and First Lady considered to be a smart way of getting in shape.<br> <br>Yoga is one of the world&#x2019;s fastest-growing health and fitness activities. The Yoga Health Foundation, based in California, puts the current number of practitioners in the United States at twenty million and around the globe at more than two hundred and fifty million. Many more people, it says, are interested in trying yoga. To spread the word, the foundation organizes Yoga Month&#x2014;a celebration every September that blankets the United States with free yoga classes, activities, and health fairs.<br> <br>By any measure, the activity is too widespread and its participants too affluent for advertisers and the news media to ignore. Health and beauty magazines do regular features. <i>The New York Times</i>, where I work, has run hundreds of articles and in 2010 began a regular column, Stretch<i>.</i> It has profiled everything from studios that offer hot yoga in overheated rooms to a gathering of thousands in Central Park that its organizers called the largest yoga class on record. A main attraction of that event was the corporate gifts. Participants got JetBlue yoga mats, SmartWater bottles, and ChicoBags filled with giveaways. The allure was so great that many people got stuck in entrance lines before a downpour chased everybody away.<br> <br>Yoga may be in the air culturally. But it is also quite visibly a big business. Merchants sell mats, clothes, magazines, books, videos, travel junkets, creams, healing potions, shoes, soy snacks, and many accessories deemed vital to practice&#x2014;as well as classes. Purists call it the yoga industrial complex. Increasingly, the big financial stakes have upended the traditional ethos. Bikram Choudhury, the founder of Bikram Yoga, a hot style, copyrighted his sequence of yoga poses and had his lawyers send out hundreds of threatening notices that charged small studios with violations. He is not alone. In the United States, yoga entrepreneurs have sought to enhance their exclusivity by registering thousands of patents, trademarks, and copyrights.<br> <br>Market analysts identify yoga as part of a demographic known as LOHAS&#x2014;for Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability. Its upscale, well-educated individuals are drawn to sustainable living and ecological initiatives. They drive hybrid cars, buy natural products, and seek healthy lifestyles. Yoga moms (a demographic successor to soccer moms) are an example. According to marketing studies, they tend to buy clothes for their children from such places as Mama&#x2019;s Earth, its goods made from organic cotton, hemp, and recycled materials.<br> <br>One factor that distinguishes modern yoga from its predecessors is its transformation from a calling into a premium lifestyle. Another is that women make up the vast majority of its practitioners, a fact that dramatically influences the nature of its marketplace. Women buy more books than men, read more, spend more on consumer goods, and pay more attention to their health and appearance.<br> <br><i>Yoga Journal</i>&#x2014;the field&#x2019;s leading magazine, founded in 1975&#x2014;claims two million readers and identifies its audience as 87 percent women. It revels in their quality, citing high incomes, impressive jobs, and good educations. A brochure for prospective advertisers notes that more than 90 percent have gone to college.<br> <br>The colorful pages of the magazine offer a vivid example of how companies target the demographic. Hundreds of ads promote skin-care products, sandals, jewelry, natural soaps, special vitamins and enzymes, alternative cures and therapies, smiling gurus, and ecofriendly cars. Each issue features an index to advertisers. One of my favorites is Hard Tail, a clothing line whose ads feature attractive women in striking poses. &#x201c;Forever,&#x201d; reads the minimalist copy.<br> <br>Another is Lululemon Athletica, a hip brand of yoga clothing known for its form-fitting apparel, most especially its ability to shape and display the buttocks to best advantage. Recently, a market analyst identified Lulu&#x2019;s signature item as the $98 Groove Pant, &#x201c;cut with all kinds of special gussets and flat seams to create a snug gluteal enclosure of almost perfect globularity, like a drop of water.&#x201d;<br> <br>All of which bears on what yoga (as opposed to its accessories) does for the body and mind or, more precisely, on what gurus, spas, books, instructional videos, merchants, television shows, magazines, resorts, and health clubs say that it does.<br> <br>In this regard, it is important to remember that yoga has no governing body. There&#x2019;s no hierarchy of officials or organizations meant to ensure purity and adherence to agreed-upon sets of facts and poses, rules and procedures, outcomes and benefits. It&#x2019;s not like a religion or modern medicine, where rigorous schooling, licensing, and boards seek to produce a high degree of conformity. And forget about government oversight. There&#x2019;s no body such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission or the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that yoga lives up to its promises. Instead, it&#x2019;s a free-for-all&#x2014;and always has been. Over the ages, that freedom has resulted in a din of conflicting claims.<br> <br>&#x201c;The beginner,&#x201d; notes I. K. Taimni, an Indian scholar, &#x201c;is likely to feel repulsed by the confusion and exaggerated statements.&#x201d; Taimni wrote that a half century ago. Today the situation is worse. For one thing, the explosion in publishing&#x2014;print and electronic&#x2014;has amplified the din into a cacophony. Another factor is the profit motive.<br> <br>Billions of dollars are now at stake in public representations of what yoga can do, and the temptations are plentiful to lace declarations with everything from self-deception and happy imprecision to willful misrepresentations and shadings of the truth. Another temptation is to avoid any mention of damage or adverse consequences&#x2014;a silence often rooted in economic rationalizations. Why tell the whole story if full disclosure might drive away customers? Why limit the sales appeal? Why not let the discipline be all things to all people?<br> <br>Anyone who has done yoga for a while can rattle off a list of benefits. It calms and relaxes, eases and renews, energizes and strengthens. It somehow makes us feel better.<br> <br>But beyond such basics lies a frothy hodgepodge of public claims and assurances, sales pitches and New Age promises. The topics include some of life&#x2019;s most central aspirations&#x2014;health, attractiveness, fitness, healing, sleep, safety, longevity, peace, willpower, control of body weight, happiness, love, knowledge, sexual satisfaction, personal growth, fulfillment, and the far boundaries of what it means to be human, not to mention enlightenment.<br> <br>This book cuts through the confusion that surrounds modern yoga and describes what science tells us. It unravels more than a century&#x2019;s worth of research to discern what&#x2019;s real and what&#x2019;s not, what helps and what hurts&#x2014;and nearly as important, why. It casts light on yoga&#x2019;s hidden workings as well as the disconcerting reality of false claims and dangerous omissions. At heart, it illuminates the risks and the rewards.<br> <br>Many, it turns out, are unfamiliar.<br> <br>I came to this book as a knowledgeable amateur. During my freshman year of college, in 1970, I got hooked on yoga because it felt good and seemed to make me healthier in body and mind. My first teacher said it was important to do some&#x2014;even a little&#x2014;every day. That&#x2019;s always been my goal, despite the usual struggle with good intentions. Yoga has become a good friend to whom I turn no matter how crazy my life gets.<br> <br>I began my research in 2006. My plan was simple. I&#x2019;d track down the best science I could find and answer a lot of questions that I had accumulated over the decades, things I had wondered about but never had a chance to explore.<br> <br>My first surprise was how yoga had morphed into a confusing array of styles and brands. I knew enough to understand that the origin of it all was Hatha yoga&#x2014;the variety that centers on postures, breathing, and drills meant to strengthen the body and the mind (as opposed to the yogas of ethics and religious philosophy). Today, Hatha and its offspring are the most widely practiced forms of yoga on the planet, having produced scores of variations that range from local styles in most every country to such ubiquitous global brands as Iyengar and Ashtanga.<br> <br>My enthusiasm for gyms and swimming also gave me a reasonable perspective on how yoga differs from regular exercise. In general (with exceptions we&#x2019;ll study closely), it goes slow rather than fast, emphasizing static postures and fluid motions rather than the rapid, forceful repetitions of, say, spinning or running. Its low-impact nature puts less strain on the body than traditional sports, increasing its appeal for young people as well as aging boomers. In terms of physiology, it takes a minimalist approach to burning calories, contracting muscles, and stressing the body&#x2019;s cardiovascular system. Perhaps most distinctively, it places great emphasis on controlling the breath and fostering an inner awareness of body position. Advanced yoga, in turn, goes further to encourage concentration on subtle energy flows. Overall, compared to sports and other forms of Western exercise, yoga draws the attention inward.<br> <br>I began examining the yogic literature with a sense of wariness. Long ago, while working at the University of Wisconsin on a study of respiratory physiology, I came across a flat contradiction to one of modern yoga&#x2019;s central tenets&#x2014;that fast breathing floods the body and brain with revitalizing oxygen. In contrast, a textbook I was reading at the time said the pace of human respiration &#x201c;can drop to one-half or rise to over one hundred times normal without appreciably influencing the amount of blood oxygenated.&#x201d; I see now that, in 1975, I underlined that passage quite heavily.<br> <br>Unfortunately, my survey lived up to my low expectations. Some books and authors shone brightly. (See Further Reading for a list.) But on the whole, I found the literature dull with dreaminess, assertions with no references, and a surprising number of obvious untruths. I wanted tips for tracking down good science but instead got a muddle. The writing, old and new, turned out to run toward the curiously dogmatic and, at best, to contain only a smattering of science. Much of it was similar to what Richard Feynman, a founder of modern physics, disparaged as cargo-cult science&#x2014;that is, material that appears scientific but lacks factual integrity.<br> <br>By contrast, my plunge into the scientific literature left me heartened. Federal officials at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, run a wonderful electronic library of global medical reports known as PubMed, short for Public Medicine. It showed that scientists had written nearly one thousand papers related to yoga&#x2014;the number rising in the early 1970s and soaring in recent years, with reports added every few days. The studies ranged from the flaky and superficial to the probing and rigorous. The authors included researchers at Princeton and Duke, Harvard and Columbia. Moreover, the field had gone global. Scientists in Sweden and Hong Kong were publishing serious papers.<br> <br>But the closer I looked, the more I judged this body of information to be rather limited. Some general topics had been covered fairly well&#x2014;for instance, how yoga can relax and heal. But many others were ignored, and much of the published science turned out to be superficial. For instance, studies for the approval of a new drug can require the participation of hundreds or even thousands of human subjects, the large numbers increasing the reliability of the findings. In contrast, many yoga investigations had fewer than a dozen participants. Some featured just one individual.<br> <br>The superficiality turned out to have fairly obvious roots. Research on yoga was often a hobby or a sideline. It had no big corporate sponsors (there being no hope of discoveries that could lead to expensive pills or medical devices) and relatively little financial support from governments. Federal centers tend to specialize in advanced kinds of esoteric research as well as pressing issues of public health, with their investigations typically carried out at institutes and universities. In short, modern science seemed to care little.<br> <br>The exception turned out to be areas where yoga intersected other disciplines or made bold claims strongly at odds with the conventional wisdom. Such crossroads proved to be scientifically rich. For instance, scientists interested in sports medicine and exercise physiology had lavished attention on yoga&#x2019;s fitness cla...</p><h2>Tom Swift and His Rocket Ship</h2><p>The third volume of the new Tom Swift Jr. series takes the brilliant young inventor into outer space in a rocket ship of his own design. On Fearing Island just off the Atlantic Coast, Tom&#39;s space craft project attracts the attention of the spies and agents of a foreign scientist whose plan is to rule the world and space. Tom Swift&#39;s advantage over his competitors is that he has perfected a rocket fuel which can carry his ship into and out of orbital flight. But it takes all of Tom and Bud&#39;s ingenuity to outwit the ruthless efforts of the foreign scientist and his desperate gang of henchmen. The flight through space makes thrilling reading--the more exciting because you know the details of the flight are scientifically accurate. Readers of Tom Swift and His Flying Lab, the first book of this new series, will recall the message that came in the shape of a meteorlike object falling into the Swift plane enclosure. In this story another message from the same mysterious source proves very valuable to Tom as he is flying through space.</p><p></p><h2>IN THE PRESENCE OF MINE ENEMIES 1965-1973 A Prisoner of War</h2><p>Illustrated - Seven years a POW in North Vietnam - The heroic story of a former POW and his wife and the faith that sustained them.</p><p></p><h2>Janus: A summing up</h2><p>&#34;To put it crudely: evolution has left a few screws loose between the neocortex and the hypothalamus.&#34; Thus Arthur Koestler defines his hypothesis of &#34;schizophysiology&#34; in Janus.

I have seen that boy wandering through the mist of the railway station, and the name of marina has flared up again like a fresh wound. We all have a secret buried under lock and key in the attic of our soul. This is mine. &#39; in may 1980, 15-year-old ?scar drai suddenly vanishes from his boarding school in the old quarter of barcelona. For seven days and nights no one knows his whereabouts. His story begins in the heart of old barcelona, when he meets marina and her father german blau, a portrait painter. Marina takes ?scar to a cemetery to watch a macabre ritual that occurs on the fourth sunday of each month. At 10 a. M. Precisely a coach pulled by black horses appears. From it descends a woman dressed in black, her face shrouded, wearing gloves, holding a single rose. She walks over to a gravestone that bears no name, only the mysterious emblem of a black butterfly with open wings.

As they did in the companion title, Loose Leashes, this husband-and-wife team combine his photographs with her poetry for a whimsical marriage of images and words.</p><p>AMY SCHMIDT has been writing children's poetry and short stories for several years. She enjoys the challenge of finding just the right form and words for her poetry. Ron and Amy live in the Northeast with their two children, Rory and Tess, and their gigantic white dog. They enjoy spending time with their family and advocating for animal welfare and literacy causes.&nbsp;<br><br>RON SCHMIDT's first photo shoot, at age ten, was a wildlife expedition of his suburban New Jersey neighborhood. Armed with an old camera he'd received as a gift, Ron took pictures of his dog and some city squirrels. After studying photography in college he worked with several high fashion and celebrity photographers before opening his own studio. As a dog lover, Ron spends most days taking photographs of man's best friend, only now he has a way better camera.Gr 1-3-Carefully posed photographs and short poems present a cast of attractive dogs appearing in human guise as they did in the Schmidts's Loose Leashes (Random, 2009). Representing schoolchildren, one pup wears safety goggles while one sports a backpack, but otherwise they are not clothed. They are all handsome, and many have naturally mournful-looking faces so that they seem expressive. Only the poems suggest that they might be active, playful, or naughty. Seeing a couple of canines seated nicely on a chair next to an office door labeled "Principal," readers are told that "one of these two fellows/chewed up their teacher's shoe." The spare use of props and settings, starting with a large yellow school bus with dogs gazing out of four windows, generally represent school activities. "Book Nook" seriously misses the mark, however, with broad shelves of what appear to be thin, identical bound files in varied colors. "Tales of knights and fairy tales,/Facts on mummies, bats, or whales!" It doesn't really look to be "this cool place." Though the scheme and poetry fall flat, both do offer nice variety in the poetic forms and dogs. A concluding "class" list identifies an impressive 31 different breeds-only one dog appears twice, though some are similar in appearance. Some teachers may find useful examples for teaching poetry, and dog-loving browsers will be attracted by these endearing animals.-Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Salt flats and marsh met Matanzas Bay and the Intra-coastal, and the water went from shallow to deep, from sloping sand to a sudden drop-off leading to a misty and strange world of fish, tangled plant growth and, despite the best efforts of local and federal lawmakers, de facto garbage dumps. <br><br>Caleb Anderson had been drawn to a shopping cart down at about twenty feet, then on to a tire rim beneath a tangle of seaweed at thirty-five, but neither one turned out to be hiding what they were looking for. <br><br>The problem was, the authorities were searching blindly. A girl named Winona Hart had disappeared. She had been at a party, but none of her underage drunken friends&#x2014;half of them potheads to boot&#x2014; seemed to know when she had left, where she had gone, or with whom. <br><br>He looked at his compass, then up through the filter of light to the cable from the police cruiser serving as their dive boat. In his mind, if anything was going to be found, it was going to be closer to the shore. Unless, of course, she'd been kidnapped by a boater and dumped somewhere beyond the bay and out in the Atlantic. If that was the case, their chances of finding her were almost nonexistent. The ocean was huge. True, if caught in a current or an undertow, a body might wash up on land. And if they came up with a suspect who regularly followed a certain route, even a weighted body might somehow be discovered. <br><br>But at the moment they were searching blindly. Still, he hadn't wanted to miss the opportunity to be in on the search, not when he had promised he would do everything humanly possible to find Jennie Lawson. Admittedly, this grim attempt was not to find Jennie but a local teen who had now been missing for nearly forty-eight hours, a case that might or might not be connected to Jennie's. No one knew if Jennie Lawson had actually made it to the beach in St. Augustine, her intended destination. They only knew that she had landed in Jacksonville, gotten off the plane and picked up a rental car. Neither she nor the car had been seen since. <br><br>He didn't have much hope of finding Jennie alive. Her mother had told him that she knew Jennie was gone, because her daughter had come to her in a dream the night before her disappearance was reported and said goodbye. Caleb wasn't sure what to believe, because Mr. Lawson seemed to think that Mrs. Lawson had lost her mind when their daughter had disappeared, and he had, in fact, made a motion behind his wife's back to indicate as much. <br><br>Caleb had heard of stranger things than ghostly midnight visits, however, so he had simply smiled and vowed to Jennie's mother that he would do everything he could to find out the truth, even if he couldn't return her daughter to her. That had comforted her. Closure was something people needed. Perhaps it was too painful to live with eternal hope. <br><br>So Caleb was also looking for Jennie, or any sign of her, even if he was officially on the trail of another young woman for whom many were still holding out hope. But this dive was important for other reasons, too; it was giving him a chance to get to know the local authorities and the local expert on the surrounding waters. <br><br>As he moved toward the marshy shore, he couldn't see more than a few feet in front of him, but he was accustomed to such conditions. His dive light illuminated the surrounding area as he searched, and he was methodical in covering his assigned section of the bay. He had seen the grid, and he meant to search his assigned area thoroughly, leaving no possibility that anything had been overlooked. As an out-of-stater, he was the odd man out here. If he did anything to make the other men&#x2014;and the one woman&#x2014;on the local forensic dive team resent his presence, he would end up ostracized, and that would be a real problem in his search for Jennie. For that reason, getting along with the police lieutenant in charge of the case, Tim Jamison, and Will Perkins, the dive master, was crucial. Caleb was there mainly as a courtesy. He worked for a private agency, Harrison Investigations. The cases they took generally had an unusual twist, something inexplicable, even supernatural, that required their very specific professional services, but in this instance it was Adam Harrison's personal friendship with Jennie Lawson's father that had brought Caleb here. <br><br>He noted a glitter of light, just this side of the dropoff. He focused his dive light, and headed toward the glint, knowing full well that it might be just another shopping basket. <br><br>But as he neared the object in the water, he knew that this was no shopping cart. <br><br>It was far too large, for one thing. The full size of it became clear as he drew closer. It was an automobile. <br><br>All too often, people intentionally discarded cars in the water. Sometimes they were just junkers and nothing more. <br><br>Sometimes they held human remains. <br><br>And as he approached the Chevy mired in the mucky, seaweed-laden sand, he saw that this car was not empty. A solid kick with his flippers brought him to the driver-side window. <br><br>A face stared out at him, the mouth widened in a giant <em>O, </em>as if in a desperate quest for breath. <br><br>The eyes... <br><br>Did not exist. Already, the creatures of the deep had started to feed. <br><br>"Maybe Osceola <em>was </em>a hero, but they still tricked him and caught him and cut his head off. They chopped it right off!" a young boy said. He was about ten, cute and normal-looking in a T-shirt that had clearly just been purchased at the local alligator farm, jeans and sneakers. But he spoke with a relish that unsettled Sarah McKinley. Caroline Roth, seated at the computer and running the audiovisual end of the Heritage House presentation, let out a soft laugh, stared at Sarah, then grinned wickedly and shrugged. <br><br>"No," Sarah said firmly, and smoothed down the skirt of her period outfit. She was a good storyteller and knew how to handle a large&#x2014;and diverse&#x2014;group like the one in the lecture hall that day, which was a mix of kids and adults, tourists and locals, couples, groups and singles. They were into the tail end of summer, so she was getting classes from schools that started early and teachers from schools that started late. There was a Harley event down in Daytona that week, so she was getting a lot of bikers, too. <br><br>One man in the crowd, though, seemed to stand out. He was tall, but not inordinately so, maybe six-three. He was dressed as casually as the next tourist in blue jeans and a polo shirt, but he didn't look like the usual tourist. He wore sunglasses throughout her lecture&#x2014;not an odd thing, lots of people didn't take them off when they came in. He was built as if he were in the service and worked out heavily on a daily basis, or as if he were an athlete. He was tanned and rugged, the way a man who spent his day sailing might be, tawny-haired and attractive. What was odd about him, though, was that he was alone. He seemed the type who should be with a beautiful woman, one who was as lithe and athletic as he was himself. <br><br>"Decapitated!" another kid called out. <br><br>Sarah's attention was drawn back to her lecture. She had been talking about Osceola, the most famous leader of the Seminole people, who had galvanized friend and foe alike when he had struck a knife into a treaty that would have been a death knell for his people. Like so many others, he had been imprisoned at the Castillo de San Marcos, the coquina shell bastion built by the Spanish that was the most imposing architectural feature of the city. <br><br>Leave it to a kid to dwell on the most gruesome fact he could think of&#x2014;not to mention that he had it wrong. <br><br>"History records lots of terrible things that were done, but that wasn't one of them," she said. <br><br>"Hey, I heard he was decapitated, too," a grown man interrupted. <br><br>Sarah took a deep breath. She couldn't really blame the guy&#x2014;who had a sunburn identifying him as out-of-state&#x2014;when even Florida schoolchildren often had the story wrong. "Osceola was a great leader, and respected even by his enemies. The treachery that led to his capture was deplorable, and despite the Indian wars raging across the country at the time, people despised General Jesup for the way he treated Osceola, who came in peace, with his safety guaranteed, and was taken anyway. But he wasn't decapitated by the U.S. Army. He was held for a while at Fort Marion, originally known as the Castillo de San Marcos, but he died of malaria up at Fort Moultrie, in South Carolina. He was attended by a shaman from his own clan, and an American doctor, a man named Frederick Wheedon, who did have his head removed and embalmed, but only after he was already dead. And," she said, unable to resist, "legend has it that Dr. Wheedon used the head to punish his children. If they behaved badly, he would leave the head on their bedposts at night. In fact, he bequeathed the head to his son-in-law&#x2014;just in case his grandchildren misbehaved. His son-in-law passed it on to a man named Valentine Mott, another doctor, who kept it in a pathology museum, but the museum burned down, and the head was lost." <br><br>She had gained the silent stares of everyone in the room, of every age, and she offered them a broad smile. "You can learn a lot about Osceola and Florida's Native Americans over at Fort Marion, and we have wonderful books on Osceola and the history of the area in our bookstore. Remember, St. Augustine is over four hundred years old." She grinned at the boy who had first brought up the subject of decapitation. "All kinds of gruesome things have happened here." <br><br>She announced that her speech was over and was given a nice round of applause, and a number of people thanked her as they walked out of the lecture hall. A few lingered to examine the artifacts in the cases that lined the walls, but she noticed that the tall stranger who had drawn her attention wasn't among them. <br><br>Caroline, rising and stretching, started laughing as soon as the last of the four o'clock lecture group walked out of the room. "A few of those kids are going to wake up in the night imagining a head on their bedpost." <br><br>"Yeah?" Sarah asked. "I don't think that many kids have bedposts anymore." <br><br>"I'm sure lots of them are staying at local B and Bs. <br><br>And lots of those beds have bedposts," Caroline reminded her. <br><br>"Well, what's a story without something scary?" Sarah asked, sinking into one of the front row seats. "And I didn't make anything up." She looked at Caroline and sighed. "Now you're going to give me a speech on being nice to tourists and downplaying our more gruesome history, right?" <br><br>Caroline shook her head. "No, not today, I'm not." She frowned suddenly, distracted. "Do you think we know him from somewhere?" <br><br>"Him who?" Sarah asked. <br><br>Caroline looked at her and laughed again. "Him who was studly and cool. Oh, come on. You couldn't possibly have missed him." <br><br>"Yeah, I saw him," Sarah said. Caroline could only be talking about the man she had noted earlier in the crowd. "But what about him?" <br><br>"I felt like I knew him, or <em>should </em>know him, from somewhere." <br><br>"He was good-looking&#x2014;" <br><br>Caroline stared at her hard. <br><br>"Okay, I admit he looked a little bit familiar, but maybe he's just so gorgeous he reminds me of a movie star or something." <br><br>Caroline shrugged. "I don't know, I just had a feeling about him.... It's like he looks like someone we once knew, only... different. I wonder if he signed in? I'll go look. And as for you scaring tourists, have some patience with the kids, huh? It's no wonder they're sounding a little gruesome. Have you seen this?" <br><br>She picked up the local newspaper, which had been lying next to her computer. <br><br>"Seen what?" Sarah asked. "I didn't read the paper today&#x2014;I left right after I woke up and came here." She winced. "It's all that hammering, you know?" <br><br>"Oh, how's that going?" Caroline asked. <br><br>"Loudly." <br><br>Which was the understatement of the year, Sarah thought. She loved the historic property she had bought after her recent return to town, but it was badly in need of not just refurbishing but reinforcement, as well. The previous owner, Mrs. Douglas, had tried to salvage it before the days of community awareness, when it might have been torn down but she hadn't had the funds to do all the necessary work. When Mrs. Douglas turned eighty, she had decided she was never going to get to it, so she decided to sell and offered the house to Sarah first, because Mrs. Douglas had been friends with Sarah's maternal grandmother. Given the house's history, the price had been amazing, another special deal because she had been so close with Sarah's grandmother, and also because Sarah's grandmother's grandmother had been born a Grant, and the property was known as the Grant House. As far as Sarah knew, her mother's side of the family had actually come from Savannah, but since the name&#x2014;whether the connection was real or imaginary&#x2014;had helped her to acquire the property, she was willing to go with it. <br><br>"I've wanted to live in that house for as long as I can remember," Sarah said. <br><br>"I remember, and I always thought you were crazy. <br><br>Old Mrs. Douglas never did anything with it, and we've been watching it crumble all these years," Caroline said. "Remember when Pete Albright went in that Halloween? How we made up the most horrifying stories and then dared him to go in? Some head of the football team! He came out white as a ghost, saying he'd quit being quarterback before he'd sleep in the place all night. He said he heard ghosts in the walls and could feel them trying to touch him. He was absolutely terrified." <br><br></p><h2>Fifty Places to Go Birding Before You Die: Birding Experts Share The World&#39;s Greatest Destinations</h2><p>It&#x2019;s estimated that 50 to 60 million Americans count birding among their hobbies.

It is clear that electric plasma research affords simpler, more elegant, and more compelling insights and explanations of most cosmological phenomena than those that are now espoused in astrophysics. This book contains astronomical science for the expert written for the public.</p><p>The author earned his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, CT. Following graduation he worked for General Electric in Schenectady, NY, and Pittsfield, MA. He earned a Doctorate in Electrical Engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, Massachusetts, and was a member of the faculty of the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts/Amherst from 1959 until his retirement in 1998. During that time he was the recipient of several good-teaching awards. He was, at various times, Assistant Department Head, Director of the undergraduate program, Graduate admissions coordinator, and Director of the College of Engineering s Video Instructional Program. In 1987, the McGraw-Hill Book Company published his 730-page textbook, An Introduction To Circuit Analysis A Systems Approach. He has authored numerous scientific papers and chapters, and is a lifelong amateur astronomer.I really love this book. It is causing me to rethink a great deal of my own work. I am convinced that The Electric Sky deserves the widest possible readership.... I felt genuine excitement while reading and felt I was delving into a delicious feast of new ideas. --Gerrit L. Verschuur, PhD, University of Manchester. A well-known radio astronomer and writer, presently at the Physics Department, University of Memphis. He is the author of "Interstellar matters : essays on curiosity and astronomical discovery".<br><br>You don't have to be an astronomer to enjoy this book. It's an exciting story about how a small group of physicists, engineers and other scientists have challenged the establishment, the big science astronomers who are reluctant to listen to anyone outside their own elite circle. --Lewis E. Franks, PhD, Stanford University, Fellow of the IEEE (1977), Professor Emeritus and Head of the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts (Retired)<br><br>It is gratifying to see the work of my mentor, Nobel Laureate Hannes Alfv�n enumerated with such clarity.

Obsessed and ambitious, they sought to solve the secrets of a mysterious, undocumented World War II German U-boat that lay under 230 feet of water, only a half-day's mission from New York Harbor. They paid the ultimate price in their quest for fame.</p><p>This gripping narrative recounts the Rouses' growing lust for what many consider the world's most dangerous sport -- as well as for the cowboy culture of the deepdiving community. Father and son were only eighteen years apart in age, and their constant battles of will earned them the nickname "the Bicker Brothers." Many friends wondered which would win out if it came down to a life-or-death diving situation: Chris's protective instincts or Chrissy's desire to surpass his father's successes.</p><p>In the surreal topographies of underwater caves and shipwrecks, divers can encounter the unfathomable. Some get lost until their air expires, some get hopelessly tangled in cables, some are drawn to deep chambers from which they never emerge, and some make simple human errors. The sport's best may eventually find themselves in silt-filled water, dark as night, and pinned by dislodged wreckage. If they panic and use up their air, they put themselves at risk of drowning or of what divers fear the most-decompression sickness, or "the bends."</p><p>Author Bernie Chowdhury, himself an expert diver and a dose friend of the Rouses', explores the thrill-seeking world of deep-sea diving, including its legendary figures, most celebrated triumphs, and gruesome tragedies. By examining the diver's psychology through the complex father-and-son dynamic, Chowdhury illuminates the extreme sport diver's push toward -- and sometimes beyond -- the limits of human endurance. </p></p><p><p>Bernie Chowdhury is the founder and co-publisher of <em>The Inteinational Technical Diving Magazine.</em> A world-class diver, Explorers Club Fellow, and a recognized expert on extreme sport diving, he also makes documentary films and is a frequent lecturer.</p>Chowdhury was friends with the father and son who die here. He's felt the fascination of the deep wrecks. He knows the "Martini Law," which states that for every 50 feet down it's as if the diver has had one martini on an empty stomach. The author tells us how he nearly perished while exploring the wreck of the Andrea Doria. When he writes about how Chrissy Rouse gets trapped in the mystery U-Boat at 230 feet, we hear the boy thumping the hull. We feel a father's terrible panic. Kevin Conway's voice is a rich, full-throated instrument. The abridgment is superb. Don't operate heavy machinery while listening to this book. B.H.C.

With cutting edge, never-before-published advances in printmaking media, <i>Printmaking Revolution</i> provides artists, students, and teachers alike with safer, environmentally friendly and non-carcinogenic methods for creating beautiful prints. Inside, teacher and professional artist, Dwight Pogue offers groundbreaking information on embracing green, petroleum-free, nontoxic materials that comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements. With new alternatives for the modern era, and work by some of today&#x2019;s most notable artists, including Janet Fish, James Rosenquist Walton Ford, and Louisa Chase, this book truly revolutionizes the techniques, materials, and processes of a time-honored medium.</p><p>Dwight Pogue is a professor of art at Smith College, where he has taught printmaking and drawing for 25 years. He is the founder and director of the Smith College Workshop, which, since 1984, has brought some of the country&#x2019;s most celebrated artists to Smith to collaborate with master printers in creating limited edition prints. A Fulbright recipient and professional artist, Pogue has work in several national juries exhibitions, as well as private and public collections. He lives in Northhampton, MA.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Also available as an eBook&nbsp;<br>Traditional lithography can now be safer and simpler with no sacrifice of quality thanks to new materials that replace phosphoric and nitric acid, acetone, naptha, asphalt, lithotine, paint thinner, and lacquer bases. The following is a step-by-step procdure for using these new materials-- first, for stone lithogrpahy, and then for ball-grained plate lithography.<br> In recent years stone lithography seems to have fallen out of favor with college and university printmaking programs, probably because of increasing environmental awareness and stricter EPA regulations. Instructors correctly wish their students to avoid working with hazardous materials, such as nitric acid and lithotine. Thanks to the innovations discussed in this book, stone lithography can once again become part of the printmaking curriculum.</p><h2>Parkers&#39; Astrology: The Essential Guide to Using Astrology in Your Daily Life</h2><p>Shows how to draw and interpret birth charts, offers extensive analysis of planetary influences, and includes case studies</p><p>With its lavish color illustrations, detailed discussions of astrological techniques, and comprehensive chart building tools, <i>Parkers' Astrology</i> is an outstanding book for any serious student of astrology. The husband and wife team of Julia and Derek Parker reissued this edition that offers many new components, such as the recently discovered comet/asteroid Chiron and its eccentric orbit. (For example, when Chiron is in Aries, the typical Arian could experience considerable restlessness.) It also includes new discussions on eclipses, Relocation Astrology, and Horary Astrology (which focuses on where and when a question is asked, rather than a birth chart). The first half offers rich color graphics and compelling narratives about the 12 sun signs, various chart reading techniques, and how astrology influences sexuality, health, business, and family. The second half delves into the nitty-gritty work of astrology and is downscaled to three-color visuals. It includes a hefty 150- page section on "The Planets at Work" and a 75-page section on astrological tables. The 1994 edition was faulted for being too difficult to build a chart from. Hopefully, astrologers will find this revised edition more accessible and consistent. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Julia and Derek Parker are a best-selling husband and wife team who have produced over 50 books, including the internationally acclaimed The Complete Astrologer and The Complete Book of Dreams.

This is the most comprehensive biographical study ever written on famous Paint Horses and contains over 200 black-and-white photos.

But in today's hectic and career-oriented environment, relationships have become a lot more complicated, and men and women are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress. To add to the increasing tension, most men and women are also completely unaware that they are actually hardwired to react differently to the stress. It's a common scenario: a husband returns home from work stressed out and eager to kick back on the couch and watch television. A wife returns home from work stressed out and wants to talk about it with her husband. What happens? Neither is on the same page, anger and resentment set in, and Mars and Venus collide. </p><p>Using his signature insight that has helped millions of couples transform their relationships, John Gray once again arms the inhabitants of Mars and Venus with information that will help them live harmoniously ever after. In <em>Why Mars and Venus Collide</em>, Gray focuses on the ways that men and women misinterpret and mismanage the stress in their daily lives, and how these reactions ultimately affect their relationships. "It's not that he's just not into you; he needs to fulfill a biological need," Gray explains. "And it's not that she wants to henpeck you; she also has a biological drive." He shows, for instance, how a husband's withdrawal is actually a natural way for him to replenish his depleted testosterone levels and restore his well-being, and how a woman's need for conversation and support helps her build her own stress-reducing hormone, oxytocin.</p><p>Backed up by groundbreaking scientific research, Gray offers a clear, easy-to-understand program to bridge the gap between the two planets, providing effective communication strategies that will actually lower stress levels. Whether in a relationship or single, this book will help both men and women understand their new roles in a modern, work-oriented society, and allow them to discover a variety of new and practical ways to create a lifetime of love and harmony.</p></p><p><p></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive: Notes on <i>Why Mars &amp; Venus Collide</i> by John Gray</strong> </p><p> Over the last fifty years, life has become more complicated. Longer working hours, intensified by grueling commutes and more traffic, the increased cost of housing, food, and health care, rising credit card debt, and the combined responsibilities of work and childcare in two-career families are only a few of the sources of stress in our fast-paced modern lives. In spite of the new technologies designed to connect us, information overload and round-the-clock accessibility via the Internet and cell phones have reduced much of our communication to the equivalent of text messaging. We are stretched to the limit, with little energy for our personal lives. Despite increased independence and opportunities for success at work, we are often left with a sense of isolation and exhaustion at home. </p><p>The unprecedented levels of stress both men and women are experiencing is taking a toll on our romantic relationships. Whether single or in committed relationships, we are often too busy or too tired to sustain feelings of attraction, motivation, and affection. Everyday stress drains our energy and patience and leaves us feeling too exhausted or overwhelmed to enjoy and support each other. </p><p>We are often too busy to see what is obvious. A man will give his heart and soul to make enough money to provide for his family and return home too tired even to talk with them. A woman will give and give to support her husband and children and then resent them for not giving back the kind of support she thrives on giving. Under the influence of stress, men and women forget why we do what we do. </p><p>Over the last fifteen years, a new trend in relationships has emerged linked to increasing stress. Both couples and singles believe they are too busy or too exhausted to resolve their relationship issues, and often think their partners are either too demanding or just too different to understand. Attempting to cope with the increasing stress of working for a living, both men and women feel neglected at home. While some couples experience increasing tension, others have just given up, sweeping their emotional needs under the carpet. They may get along, but the passion is gone. </p><p>Without an understanding of our different needs, men and women are adjusting their actions and reactions to no avail. Our actions may be pointed in the wrong direction. <i>Why Mars and Venus Collide</i> provides a new understanding and a variety of techniques you will need to counter the disruptive effects of stress and to steer a true course to a lifetime of love. </p><p>Remembering and understanding our differences are only half the battle. The other half is about action--learning to cope more effectively with stress. This book aims to help you discover new ways to lower your own stress and help to lower your partner&#x2019;s. Whether you are in a relationship, starting over, or single, you will discover a variety of new and practical ways to improve your communication, uplift your mood, increase your energy, elevate levels of attraction in your relationship, create harmony with your partner, and enjoy a lifetime of love and romance. You will learn why communication breaks down or why your relationships have failed in the past, and what you can do now to ensure success in the future.</p><p>John Gray, Ph.D., is one of the world&#x2019;s leading relationship experts, and an authority on improving communication styles for couples, companies, and communities. His many books have sold more than fifty million copies in fifty different languages worldwide.

There are memorable accounts of Stravinsky telling Proust how much he hates Beethoven, of Tchaikovsky&#39;s first bewildering telephone call, of Dvorak&#39;s strange love of pigeons, and of Verdi&#39;s intricate maneuvering to keep the now-famous melody of La donna e mobile top secret.There is also wonderful trivia (Beethoven loved to cat bread soup made with ten raw eggs), along with eccentric strategies (Verdi, disturbed by the sound of street organs playing arias from his operas, hired them all for a season and kept them locked in a room). There are examples of musicians munificent generosity (Haydn called Mozart the greatest composer known to me, either in person or by name), and scathing dismissal (Have you heard any Stockhausen? the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham was asked. No, he replied, but I believe I have trodden in some).Collected from thousands of books, articles, and unpublished manuscripts (with historical sources provided in extensive notes), these anecdotes appear in their original form, throwing fresh light on familiar figures in the musical hall of fame. For browsing, reading, research and amusement, this book is a grand entertainment for concert-goers, record-buyers, operamanes, gossips and music lovers everywhere.</p><p><b>Norman Lebrecht</b> writes on music and other arts for the London <i>Sunday Times.</i> He is author of <i>Discord: Conflict and the Making of Music.</i><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <i>Thomas Augustine ARNE (1710-1778)</i> </p><p> The composer of 'Rule Britannia!', Arne wrote extensively for the London theatre. </p><p> <i>79 </i></p><p><i> Charles Burney, Arne's pupil</i> </p><p> He never cd pass by a woman in the street, to the end of his Life without Concupiscence or, in plain Engl. <i>picking her up,</i> if her look was not forbidding, &amp; impracticable. It has frequently happened in walking home with my Wife of a Night, if we have by some accident been separated for a few minutes, that she has been accosted by the Dr with that design, ere I cd overtake her or he knew to whom she belonged.' </p><p> <i>80</i> </p><p> Doctor Arne once went to Cannons, the seat of the late Duke of Chandos, to assist at the performance of an oratorio in the Chapel of Whitchurch; but such was the throng of company, that no provisions were to be procured at the Duke's house. On going to the Chandos Arms, in the town of Edgeware, the Doctor made his way into the kitchen, where he found only a leg of mutton on the spit. This, the waiter informed him, was bespoken by a party of gentlemen. 'The Doctor determined to have the mutton, took a fiddle-string, cut it in pieces, and, secretly sprinkling it over the mutton, walked out of the kitchen. Then, waiting very patiently till the waiter had served it up, he heard one of the gentlemen exclaim -- 'Waiter! this meat is full of <i>maggots:</i> take it away!' This was what the Doctor expected. -- 'Here, give it <i>me,'</i> he said. 'O, sir,' says the waiter, 'you can't eat it -- 'tis full of maggots.' -- 'Nay, never mind,' cries the Doctor, 'fiddlers have strong stomachs.' So, bearing it away, and scraping off the catgut, he got a hearty dinner. </p><p> <i>81</i> </p><p> The father of Dr Arne was an upholsterer in Covent Garden; and, finding that his son was bent on music, engaged a foreigner of some abilities to give him lessons on the violin. The master coming one evening, as usual, discovered, to his astonishment, young Arne practising with his desk on a coffin in the wareroom. Upon this, he expressed some surprise, and added, that he should not be able to study for thinking it contained a corpse. 'So it does,' replied the juvenile musician; and, pushing the lid off, exposed the body; which so affected the master, that he never could be prevailed upon to visit his pupil again. </p><p> <i>CAFFARELLI (1710-1783)<br> [b. Gaetano Majorano]</i> </p><p> Italian castrato for whom Handel wrote his famous 'Largo'. His celebrity was second only to Farinelli's. </p><p> <i>82</i> </p><p> Like many of his neutered kind, Caffarelli was attractive to women, offering virility without risk of conception. He was not safe, however, from the other dangers of illicit carnality. Apprehended in <i>flagrante delicto</i> by a returning husband in Rome in 1728, the castrato narrowly escaped vengeance in authentic <i>opera buffa</i> style, by hiding all night in a disused water tank where he caught a cold that incapacitated him for weeks. Moreover, the husband was sworn to revenge and Caffarelli had to spend the rest of his time in Rome under the protection of four bodyguards hired by his anxious beloved. </p><p> <i>FREDERICK the Great (1712-1786)<br> Friedrich II of Prussia</i> </p><p> Flautist, composer and conqueror, who established Berlin as a musical centre by providing a court orchestra and building an opera house. C. P. E. Bach was his harpsichordist; his father's Musical Offering was composed on a theme of the king's invention. </p><p> <i>83 </i></p><p><i> Frederick to his Swiss companion, Henri de Catt</i> </p><p> After dinner I play on the flute to aid digestion; I sign my letters and I again read until four o'clock. At that hour you will come to me; we will talk until six when my little concert begins. If passable music can amuse you, it only depends on you to hear it; everything is over at half-past seven. After the concert, which I have only in country quarters, I pitilessly scribble paper with prose and verse until nine o'clock, when I put myself into the arms of Morpheus. </p><p> <i>84</i> </p><p> Frederick II, personally fond of music and literature, had a special liking for the philosopher Mendelssohn grandfather of the composer, and would often seat him at his own side at dinner. An ambassador, jealous of the privilege accorded to a commoner and a Jew, insinuated to the King that Mendelssohn was 'a man who would consider nobody, and would offend your Majesty if it so happened that for some imaginary reason he thought himself hurt.' </p><p> 'I should like to see that,' said the King, 'but I shall give him no reason for feeling hurt, and, any way, he would not offend <i>me.'</i> </p><p> 'Is it a wager?' asked the Ambassador. </p><p> 'Certainly,' replied the King. </p><p> 'Will your Majesty at the next supper-party write on a piece of paper, "Mendelssohn is an ass," and put that paper, signed by your own hand on his table?' </p><p> 'I will not; that would be a gratuitous rudeness.' </p><p> 'It is only to see what he would do,...the paper must be signed "Frederick the Second" so that he cannot afterwards say he did not know that they were written by the King.' </p><p> Reluctantly, but with a feeling of curiosity as to how it would all end, the King wrote and signed the paper as required. </p><p> The evening came; the table was laid for twelve, the fatal paper was on Mendelssohn's plate, and the guests, several of whom had been informed of what was going on, assembled, eager for the fray. </p><p> Mendelssohn sat down, being rather shortsighted and observing the paper, he held it very near his eye, and having read it, gave a start. </p><p> 'What is the matter?' said the King. 'No unpleasant news, I hope, Mendelssohn.' </p><p> 'Oh no,' said Mendelssohn, 'it is nothing.' </p><p> 'Nothing? Nothing would not have made you start. I demand to know what it is.' </p><p> 'Oh, it is not worth while --' </p><p> 'But I tell you that it is; I command you to tell me.' </p><p> 'Oh, if your Majesty commands me, I will say that some one has taken the liberty to make a joke of rather bad taste with your Majesty; I'd rather not --' </p><p> 'With me? Pray do not keep me waiting any longer. What is it?' </p><p> 'Why, somebody wrote here, "Mendelssohn is <i>one</i> ass, Frederick <i>the second."'</i> </p><p> <i>Jean-Jacques ROUSSEAU (1712-1778)</i> </p><p> The Swiss philosopher was a competent composer (his opera <i>Le Devin du village</i> was widely performed) and historian of music <i>(Dictionnaire de musique,</i> 1768). </p><p> <i>85</i> </p><p> One morning when I was at his house I saw various domestics either coming for rolls of music, or bringing them to him to copy. He received them standing and uncovered. He said to some, 'The price is so much,' and received the money; to others, 'How soon must I return my copy?' 'My mistress would like to have it back in a fortnight.' 'Oh, that's out of the question: I have work, I can't do it in less than three weeks.' I inquired why he did not take his talents to better market. 'Ah,' he answered, 'there are two Rousseaus in the world: one rich, or who might have been if he had chosen; a man capricious, singular, fantastic; this is the Rousseau of the public; the other is obliged to work for his living, the Rousseau whom you see.' </p><p> <i>86</i> </p><p> Rousseau was especially hated by the French orchestral players, of whom, in his writings, he always speaks with unmeasured contempt. Gr�try, in his <i>M�moires,</i> says, that while Rousseau was superintending the rehearsals of his <i>Devin du village,</i> he treated the band so cavalierly, that they, in revenge, hanged him in effigy. 'Well,' said Rousseau, 'I don't wonder that they should hang me now, after having so long put me to the torture.' </p><p> <i>87 </i></p><p><i> Rousseau, at the age of twenty, sets out to win fame and fortune from music</i> </p><p> From the name Rousseau I made the anagram Vaussore, and called myself Vaussore de Villeneuve. I knew nothing about composition and boasted of my skill to everybody; and although I could not score the simplest drinking song, I claimed to be a composer. That is not all. Having been introduced to M. de Treytorens, professor of law, who was a music-lover and held concerts at his house, I decided to give him a sample of my talents, and began to compose a piece for his concert with as much boldness as if I had known how to set about it. I had the persistence to work for a fortnight on this fine composition, to make a fair copy of it, write out the parts, and distribute them with as much assurance as if they had been a musical masterpiece. Finally -- a fact that will be hard to believe, though it is really true -- to crown this sublime production in a fitting manner, I tacked on a pretty minuet, which was sung in all the streets... </p><p> Venture had taught me this air with its bass accompaniment, I tacked [it] on to the end of my composition, and claimed it as my own with as much confidence as if I were addressing the inhabitants of the moon. </p><p> The players assembled to perform my piece. I explained to each the method of timing, the manner of interpretation and the cues for repeats. The five or six minutes spent in tuning up were five or six centuries to me. At last all was ready. I gave five or six premonitory taps on my conductor's desk with a handsome roll of paper. Attention! All was quiet. Gravely I began to beat time. They began. Throughout all the history of French opera never was there heard such a discordant row. Whatever they might have thought of my pretended talents, the effect was worse than anything they seem to have expected. The musicians were choking with laughter; the audience goggled their eyes, and would gladly have stopped their ears; but they had not the means. My wretched orchestra, who were out to amuse themselves, scraped loudly enough to pierce a deaf man's ear-drums. I had the audacity to go right on, sweating big drops, it is true, but kept there by shame, I had not the courage to bolt and make my escape. For my consolation, I heard the audience around me whisper into one another's ears, or rather into mine: 'It's absolutely unbearable'; or 'What crazy music!'; or 'What a devil of a din!' Poor Jean-Jacques, at that cruel moment you could hardly expect that one day your music would excite murmurs of surprise and applause, when played before the King of France and all his Court, and that in all the boxes around the most charming ladies would say half aloud: 'What delightful sounds! What enchanting music! Every one of those airs goes straight to the heart!' </p><p> Copyright � 1985 by Norman Lebrecht</p></p><h2>The Woman Upstairs</h2><p><p>From the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Emperor&#x2019;s Children,</i> a masterly new novel: the riveting confession of a woman awakened, transformed and betrayed by a desire for a world beyond her own.<br><br> Nora Eldridge, an elementary school teacher in Cambridge, Massachusetts, long ago compromised her dream to be a successful artist, mother and lover. She has instead become the &#x201c;woman upstairs,&#x201d; a reliable friend and neighbor always on the fringe of others&#x2019; achievements. Then into her life arrives the glamorous and cosmopolitan Shahids&#x2014;her new student Reza Shahid, a child who enchants as if from a fairy tale, and his parents: Skandar, a dashing Lebanese professor who has come to Boston for a fellowship at Harvard, and Sirena, an effortlessly alluring Italian artist. <br><br> When Reza is attacked by schoolyard bullies, Nora is drawn deep into the complex world of the Shahid family; she finds herself falling in love with them, separately and together. Nora&#x2019;s happiness explodes her boundaries, and she discovers in herself an unprecedented ferocity&#x2014;one that puts her beliefs and her sense of self at stake. <br><br> Told with urgency, intimacy and piercing emotion, this brilliant novel of passion and artistic fulfillment explores the intensity, thrill&#x2014;and the devastating cost&#x2014;of embracing an authentic life.<br></p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2013</strong>: If this ferocious novel were to have a subtitle, it would be: <em>No More Ms. Nice Guy</em>. "How angry am I? You don&#x2019;t want to know. Nobody wants to know about that," barks Nora Eldridge, our 42-year-old protagonist, an aesthete-wannabe who has slid into the bourgeois suburban life of a schoolteacher. Solipsistically lonely, Nora befriends--a polite term here for what is more like "stalks"--the artist-mother of one of her students; she also insinuates herself into the life of the woman's husband. That trouble will ensue is obvious to everyone but Nora, who for all her paranoia, is stunningly blind about using and being used. But in the end, maybe Nora doesn&#x2019;t even care what she has suffered; at least, for once, she has <em>lived</em>, as she will continue to do in the minds of all of us who've read about her. --<em>Sara Nelson</em><p>Claire Messud&#x2019;s most recent novel, <i>The Emperor&#x2019;s Children, </i>was a <i>New York Times, Los Angeles Times </i>and <i>Washington Post </i>Best Book of the Year.

Jason lives in North Carolina.</p>For once, death took pity.<br><br>That is what the people of Stone Temple would say in the time that came after. It was late autumn and the townspeople were preparing for an early winter. The clouds were heavy in the days before the Fall Festival and that always meant hard, cold months ahead. The festival was their way of saying goodbye to short sleeves and tourist season, cicadas and apple brandy on the front porch at sunset.<br><br>The highlight would be Matt Cooper, who would come and entertain them with stunts in his airplane. He was one of only two people to venture out from Stone Temple and return with the world knowing his name. He had become a pilot for a traveling air show troop and, when he could, he came to town with his red-white-and-blue-painted biplane to show the people of this small town that he had not forgotten them. He would land it in the open field where the town held festivals and barbecues, and the townspeople loved him not only for his stunts, but because of how he had defied the fates of so many others who left the town, were broken by the world and returned with their hats in hand.<br><br>So on the day of the festival, the Ferris wheel was set up along with the tents for games and vendors and places where sweet foods could be cooked and there was a competition for blue-ribbon vegetables and a competition for the best gingerbread recipe. The entire town came out and the air was sweet and thick for miles when the day got late and Matt Cooper finally climbed into his airplane and buzzed above the earth. The townspeople took seats in makeshift bleachers and the old concrete grain silo was converted into an announcing booth. A pair of men sat atop it calling out all of Matt Cooper's tricks and techniques. They frequently remarked on both the inherent danger and, whenever they could, on the fact that he was a native of Stone Temple who had "done good." Folks craned their necks and held their breaths.<br><br>The plane ascended&#x2014;straight up, the propeller chopping air, the engine buzzing, the sound of it softening as it stretched the rubber band of gravity, lifting into the heavens. Mountains could be stacked between man and earth just then. Finally, the crowd could hold their breaths no longer. They exhaled and, even though they knew full well that Matt Cooper could not hear them, they applauded.<br><br>It was when the tide of their applause was receding that they heard the sound of the engine sputter. The drone was broken, then restarted, then broken again. It went this way three times before only silence fell from the sky above. The silence remained. Because the plane was so far above them, it took a moment for the crowd to understand that it was falling. For so very long it seemed to be stationary&#x2014;a dim, red star burning in the distance. Then the silence washed away and there came the long, dark aria of a man&#x2014;who the town of Stone Temple believed was the best of them&#x2014;falling to earth.<br><br>It was difficult to measure the space of time between when Matt Cooper's plane began falling and when it finally crashed into the earth. Some would later say it was all too fast to understand. Others that they had never known horror could last so long.<br><br>Then the waiting ended.<br><br>Matt Cooper was dead and there was a fire burning and the grain silo upon which the announcers had been seated lay broken, with the fragments of Matt Cooper's airplane scattered around it like dropped leaves. Everything was panic.<br><br>But for whatever reason that such things sometimes come to pass, fortune was kind. Debris from the plane washed over the crowd like sea foam. It left them bloodied and, in some cases, with broken bones, but Death stayed its hand. As people took stock of one another&#x2014;still trying to douse the fire, still sifting through the rubble of the grain silo&#x2014;the only death anyone could count was that of Matt Cooper, who died instantly when his plane hit the silo. Even the announcers, perched atop it like a bird, had somehow come out alive. The more time that came and went, the more people waited for bodies to be found&#x2014;for the number of the living in this world to be lessened. But it was a day of miracles.<br><br>So it was with nervousness that the boy and girl were found buried in a pocket of concrete and steel beneath the grain silo. It was built with an infrastructure of steel piping that, when felled by the plane, created small pockets. Macon Campbell, the town sheriff&#x2014;a dark-skinned, overworked man who had made it through the lion's share of his thirties with only a handful of things he wished he'd done differently&#x2014;could just make out the pair of children held within the rubble. For a moment they were only shapes in dim lighting. Then he understood that one of them was his daughter, Ava. The other, her best friend, a boy named Wash.<br><br>The fear that came over him was like swallowed lightning.<br><br>"Ava!" he called out. "Ava! Wash! Can you hear me?"<br><br>His daughter responded by moving her hand. Her body was bent at an awkward angle&#x2014;fetal, pulled in on itself like a ribbon&#x2014;and she was half buried by debris. But she was alive. "Thank God," Macon said. "It's going to be okay. I'm going to get you out."<br><br>She looked up at him with fear and tears in her eyes. Her lip quivered and she looked around, as if trying to understand how all of this had happened, as if the world had broken some promise she had always believed in. There was concrete and steel around her&#x2014;sharp and waiting to come crashing down.<br><br>"Can you move?" Macon asked.<br><br>She answered by moving. First her hand&#x2014;slowly, tentatively. Then, little by little, the other parts of her body. There was concrete atop her legs but, after some maneuvering, she freed herself.<br><br>"Don't move too much," Macon said. He spoke through a small, narrow breach in the rubble. He could fit his arm and part of his shoulder through it, but that was all. It would take help and time to move the rubble and safely get to the children. He called to the crowd behind him for help. "There are children here," he shouted.<br><br>It was after she had gotten her legs free that Ava saw the boy, Wash. He was unconscious and buried up to his chest in rubble. "Wash?" she said. He did not answer and she could not tell if he was breathing. "Wash?" she called again. His face was streaked with dust and there was a small bruise on his brow. By nature, the boy was pale&#x2014;something that Ava teased him about as often as she could manage&#x2014;but, just now, there was something different in his pallor. He looked blanched, like a photograph left too long in the sun. It was then that she saw the steel rod jutting out of his side, and the blood seeping from the wound. "Wash!" Ava yelled, and she started crawling toward him.<br><br>"Ava, don't move," Macon yelled. Again he tried to fit through the small gap in the rubble. Again only his arm and shoulder fit. "Ava, be still," he said. "This thing isn't stable."<br><br>She did not stop. She only kept her eyes on Wash, and continued crawling toward him. When she reached the boy she whispered his name. When he did not reply she put her hands on his face and hoped to feel something that might indicate that he was alive. Then she leaned close to his face, just above his open mouth, and tried to feel his breath. But it was difficult to tell what she was feeling. She was bruised and scratched from the fallen silo. She was frightened. Every nerve of her body seemed to be speaking to her at once. It drowned out any breathing she might have felt slide from Wash's lips.<br><br>"Is he alive?" Macon called.<br><br>"I don't know," Ava replied. "He's hurt." She placed her hand on his neck and hoped for a pulse, but her hands were shaking and the only heartbeat she could feel was the frightened thundering of her own.<br><br>"How is he hurt?" Macon asked. Finally help was arriving&#x2014;firemen and volunteers. But they were only in the beginning stages of solving the riddle of how to stabilize the debris and get to the children.<br><br>Ava heard her father barking orders. She heard people shouting replies. There was talk of two-by-fours, steel rods, floor jacks, cranes. It soon became simply a choir of garbled voices. For Ava, there was only the wound in Wash's side, the sight of his blood spilling into the dust.<br><br>"I've got to do something," Ava said. She gripped him beneath his shoulders.<br><br>"No," Macon yelled. "Don't move him. Don't touch him."<br><br>But it was too late. She tugged at his shoulders and, as soon as she did, the debris that was covering him shifted in one great, awful lurch. The steel rod that was protruding into his side came free. His blood flowed faster.<br><br>Macon called out for more help.<br><br>Ava cried. She said, over and over again in a terrified voice, "I'm sorry...I'm sorry..." Her hands leaped nervously in front of her. She did not know where to put them. She was torn between her desire to help the boy and the truth that what she had just done made things worse.<br><br>"Ava!" Macon called. Eventually, his daughter heard him.<br><br>"I'm sorr y," she said.<br><br>"Don't think about it," Macon replied. "Just put your hands over the wound. Put your hands over it to help slow the bleeding. Just hold on." For a third time, even though he knew it was pointless, he tried to maneuver his way through the small opening in the rubble. For a third time he failed. "Just put your hands on his side and press down, baby," he said.<br><br>Slowly, Ava pressed her hands over Wash's side. She felt the pulse of his blood as it spilled over her hands. She closed her eyes and cried. She hoped. She prayed. She called out to a god that, being only thirteen, she did not know that she understood or even believed in. But, just now, at this moment, she would believe in anything or anyone. She would give anything for her best friend to live, to be healed.<br><br>And then there was something akin to cold in her hands. A numbness in her palms and a feeling of needles racing up the length of her arms. The sound of her father calling for her faded away. The sound of everything receded and the darkness of her closed eyes was darker than any she had ever experienced before.<br><br>In the darkness, she saw him. Wash. He stood in the center of the darkness, the pale hue of his skin almost glowing. He was bruised and there was a cut on his brow. His clothes were covered with dirt from the fallen grain silo. The right side of his shirt was torn and there was blood pouring from the wound. But the boy did not seem to notice any of this. He only looked at Ava with a face that betrayed nothing.<br><br>"It's okay," Wash said. But, somehow, his words were in the voice of Ava's mother&#x2014;dead for five years now. "It's going to be okay." He smiled&#x2014;the small freckles dotting his face looked like cinnamon sprinkled over cloth. When he laughed, he laughed in the voice of Ava's mother.<br><br>Then Ava's eyes were open. Her father was still shouting her name. Her body was still bruised and sore. She still kneeled beside Wash with her hands covering his side&#x2014;her fingers sticky with blood. She heard ambulances. She heard yelling. She heard people crying&#x2014;crying out of fear, crying at the loss of Matt Cooper, crying because they could not understand how the day had turned so harsh so quickly.<br><br>Then she heard the sound of Wash's voice.<br><br>"Ava?" Wash said, opening his eyes. "Ava? What did you do?" He reached across his stomach and placed his left hand atop hers.<br><br>"No, Wash!" she said quickly. "I have to keep my hands over it! You're bleeding! I've got to stop the bleeding!" But there was no strength in her. She felt light-headed and could not resist as Wash took her hands away.<br><br>Beneath where her hands had been&#x2014;where, once, there was a steel rod protruding into the boy, puncturing organs and promising that even the lives of children were not guaranteed in this world&#x2014;there was only the boy's skin, perfect and unharmed.<br><br>"What did you do?" Wash asked again, looking up at her.<br><br>Then, for Ava, the world began to slide, as if the hinges that kept the earth level were broken. The sight of Wash became a glimmering dimness. Then the dimness faded, replaced by an empty, unbounded darkness.<br><br>The news of her healing the boy spread like wildfire.<br><br>Someone had been there with the camera of their cell phone running. The video was uploaded and shared and transmitted around the world. It leaped from screens to eyes to lips to ears, fanned by the flame of imagination of a planet that had been too long harboring a secret hope for some type of confirmation of the miraculous.<br><br>For the next few days in the hospital, Ava's father sat by her side and held her hand. He would talk to her, though she was not always aware enough to recognize him. She existed in a haze, but she could tell by her father's face that she was not well. He seemed worried and afraid and reluctant, but he also wore a look of purpose. It was the way he had looked at her when, once, she and Wash were playing in the forest behind the house and she fell upon a shard of wood that stabbed nearly an inch and a half into her thigh.<br><br>Macon had brought her into the house and sat her at the kitchen table, looking at the wound and the splint of wood protruding from it like a crude arrow. He had the same expression he wore at her bedside now, an expression that told her there was a hard task to be done before the healing could begin.<br><br>Around the room Ava could see other people standing, waiting. Most of them were doctors, but there were others, too. People with cameras and microphones. Everyone in the room, including Macon, wore security badges. Each time someone opened the door to enter the room, the sound of shouting and the flashing of camera lights poured in from the hallway. Ava could see a trio of policemen standing outside.<br><br>"Ava?" Macon called out. She did not realize it, but she had drifted off to sleep again. Her body felt far away and floating, like a balloon resting on the surface of a lake, and she struggled to keep her eyes open. "Ava, can you hear me?" Macon said. "I'm going to ask you a couple of questions for these nice people, okay? You just look at me and pretend it's just the two of us. I promise it'll be quick."<br><br></p><h2>Called to Pray:</h2><p>What is the reason that prayer is important?

Hunter's enchanting debut combines bewitching illustrations and a magical story that celebrates the beauty of autumn. As Possum gazes at a splendid full moon one autumn evening, he is inspired to throw a party. He hurries off to invite his friends to his Harvest Soiree, but it seems everyone is too busy getting ready for the long winter to come: the mice are gathering seeds, the raccoon is eating fish to fatten up, and the frogs are preparing to go underground for their hibernation. Dejected, Possum sits alone in his party hat. Then the moon begins to work its magic, and every creature pauses to admire its beauty. Suddenly, Possum is surrounded by friends, who, like all good guests, bring munchies and music and eat and dance until the moon sinks low and it's time to go home for winter's long sleep. Possum's secret world is beautifully rendered in subtle earth tones and exquisitely detailed with delicate pen-and-ink line work. The artwork has great child appeal, and little ones will love the wonderful simplicity of the story, which will not only be great for lap sharing but also complement a study of the seasons. <i>Lauren Peterson</i></p><h2>Race to the Pole: Tragedy, Heroism, and Scott&#39;s Antarctic Quest</h2><p><strong>The real story of Captain Robert Scott's legendary Antarctic quest, told by the man whom the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em></strong> has proclaimed "the world's greatest living explorer," Sir Ranulph Fiennes.<p>During the Golden Era of Exploration, Captain Robert Scott and his competitor Roald Amundsen conquered the unconquerable: Antarctica. This perilous race to the South Pole claimed the life of Scott and became the stuff of legend, as well as endless scrutiny. In this compelling, meticulously researched biography of Captain Scott and his fatal journey, renowned modern-day explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, holder of 10 expeditionary records, has written what is sure to become the definitive book on this hotly debated subject.</p><p><em>Race to the Pole</em> provides a level of immediacy and accuracy that no other account has ever approached. Fiennes gained the exclusive cooperation of the Scott estate, as well as access to the descendants of key players, including those of Amundsen. As an explorer who has led over 30 expeditions, including the first polar circumnavigation of the earth and the first unsupported crossing of the Antarctic continent, he has firsthand knowledge of the grueling feat that Scott and his team undertook, as well as the physical tortures they endured.</p><p>Infused with the intensity of fiction and exhibiting an exhaustive eye for detail found in the greatest historical biographies, <em>Race to the Pole</em> is a prodigious achievement and certain to become a classic in the literature of exploration.</p></p><p><strong>Sir Ranulph Fiennes</strong> was the first man to reach both Poles on land, and he is the only person to have been awarded two clasps to the Polar Medal for both Antarctic and Arctic regions. In 1993, Fiennes was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for "human endeavor and charitable services." He is the author of many books, including his autobiography, <em>Living Dangerously</em>, and <em>Mind Over Matter</em>, a harrowing account of his Antarctic expedition. Most recently, he set a world record by running seven marathons in seven days on seven continents. He lives in Somerset, England.David Povall offers an intelligent, listenable reading of this re-revisionist biography of Captain Robert Scott's fatal race to the South Pole. Present-day explorer Ranulph Fiennes has an ego the size of the Pole that he, too, has crossed. (As he explains many times, only HE knows the Antarctic well enough to be able to write an accurate Scott biography.) Fiennes seeks to reinstate Scott as a tragic hero rather than an incompetent amateur. To do this, he blends reminiscences of his own Pole crossings with an account of Scott's attempt. The results are mixed--sometimes infuriating, sometimes believable, always interesting. David Povall reads the history sections in an engaged, well-paced manner that never loses the listener, and he offers an intense but not-too-dramatic rendition of Scott's travails. Perfect for history buffs and armchair adventurers.

The human body is designed to function for the full length of its life--and with gentle, full-body flexibility and strengthening exercises we can look and feel tremendous, vibrant and active at any age, and well into our senior years. After all, the body is the world's most efficient self-healing machine. And yet, remarkably, many of us neglect the single most important system in the body--the one that makes all the others work--the muscular system.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The typical message we get as we age is that we can move less and should take it easy--exactly the wrong advice. Surprisingly, fitness enthusiasts often do as much harm to their bodies as people living sedentary lives. For example, yoga instructors get tennis elbow or carpal tunnel syndrome from daily stress on wrists and elbows; Pilates instructors suffer pectoral and tricep muscle atrophy and even professional athletes grow overweight and suffer countless ACL, meniscus and disc injuries. Ligaments are virtually ignored by most exercises routines and yet joint health is essential in order to remain active. But these afflictions don't happen overnight, and with <i>Aging Backwards </i>we can slow or prevent their onset, and often reverse their symptoms.</p><p><p>"Every day, we have a very clear choice: We can grow older or we can grow younger."</p><p>In recent years the field of aging research has exploded with new clinical findings. Many widely accepted ideas about aging&#x2014;including those about the inevitability of our declining metabolism, our dying brain cells, and our deteriorating muscles and bones&#x2014;have been debunked. Today we know that the physical signs of aging are far more a product of lifestyle choices than of calendar years. <em>Aging Backwards</em> offers an exciting and comprehensive plan for actively slowing down and even reversing the aging process through gentle exercise that develops strong, flexible muscles.</p><p>Why focus on strengthening muscles? Because as Miranda Esmonde-White, PBS fitness personality and creator of the Essentrics technique, explains, our muscle cells are the keys to our longevity. The powerhouses of our cells, the mitochondria, keep us looking and feeling young&#x2014;and muscle cells contain more mitochondria than any other part of our body. If we can keep our mitochondrian fires burning, our muscles&#x2014;not to mention our bones, hearts, lungs, and skin&#x2014;can all experience the vitality of youth. And the best news of all is that it takes just thirty minutes a day of gentle exercise to keep muscles strong. </p><p>With eight basic age-reversing workouts that build core strength, lengthen and tone muscle, increase flexibility, and speed weight loss, <em>Aging Backwards</em> offers the information and tools to live longer, healthier, and happier lives.</p>MIRANDA ESMONDE-WHITE began her career as a ballet dancer, performing around the world with the National Ballet of Canada. Shortly after leaving the company she opened her own dance and fitness centre in Montreal, but soon realized that the popular workouts of the day left her clients' muscles looking bulky and were jarring on their joints. So, with the mentorship of doctors, physiotherapists and feedback from her clients and fans, she set about designing the "anti-aerobics" workout that became Classical Stretch and Essentrics. As a result, Esmonde-White has become one of the most sought-after stretch and bio-mechanics trainers in Canada. She is well known for her work with Olympic medalist diver Alexandre Despatie, world champion squash player Jonathon Power, Canadian skating champions Joannie Rochette, Jessica Dub� and Bryce Davidson, members of the Montreal Canadiens and students from the Cirque du Soleil School/�cole National de Cirque. For the past 15 years she has been the host of a daily exercise show on the PBS Network in the USA, has written a college textbook and is the host of a series of <i>Classical Stretch </i>and<i> Essentrics </i>DVDs. She also holds regular workshops for Level 4 Olympic coaches as well as for universities and colleges, and travels internationally, giving lectures on Breast Cancer rehabilitation.

During his time at Marvel Comics, he discovered and mentored many top comics talents, including Jim Lee, Whilce Portacio, and Mike Mignola. Currently, Potts consults for a variety of publishing, interactive, and entertainment companies, including HarperCollins, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, and the Learning Company. In addition, he&#x2019;s given seminars on visual storytelling techniques at the School of Visual Arts, Parsons, New York University, LucasArts, Academy of Art University, and the Savannah College of Art and Design.Nothing gives me greater pleasure than introducing the art of visual storytelling as presented by my mentor and art guru, Carl Potts. For the most part, everything I learned about creating comics can be divided into two periods: the time BC&#x2014;also known as &#x201c;Before Carl&#x201d;&#x2014;and the time after, which I call &#x201c;conquering the deep, dark void.&#x201d; In years 1 to 22 BC, I struggled to learn the art of visual storytelling. Just because you have a love for reading comics and some innate drawing talent, that does not mean you automatically qualify as a comic book artist. In fact, I think it works against you, because you think you know more than you actually do. You think that you draw better than your least favorite professional artist even if you can&#x2019;t complete an entire page of panel-to-panel continuity by yourself. Ever. That was me.<br> <br>But somewhere deep inside, I realized I needed to improve. (Because no one was giving me any work, right?) So I learned all I could about comics and visual storytelling through the few books that were available at the local library. However, it wasn&#x2019;t until I met Carl through another Marvel Comics editor&#x2014;the late, great Archie Goodwin&#x2014;that I started on my true path toward enlightenment in the deep, dark void. Because that&#x2019;s what art can be when you realize you need to start all over again. You have to drop any artifice or defensive shields (the ones you create to preemptively protect yourself from cruel criticism) and accept the fact that there&#x2019;s a lot more to this artform than meets the eye. You have to learn the basics all over again. For real this time. With feeling. Wax on, wax off.<br><br> And that&#x2019;s where Carl served as my guide. My sensei. My Jedi master. And teach me he did: everything from &#x201c;the 22 panels that always work&#x201d; by Wally Wood to &#x201c;how not to cross the line.&#x201d; He gave me telephone book&#x2013;thick tomes of photocopies from books explaining all the ins and outs of cinematic terminology and visual storytelling. Carl passed along handwritten memos explaining what I did well (not much) and what I did wrong (though constructively polite) as I turned in tryout page after tryout page. Carl laid out several of my biggest projects so that I could work over his thumbnails.<br><br> I absorbed all those lessons until I thought I was ready to snatch the stone from his hand&#x2014;the initiation all new artists had to endure and complete to take a place at the vaunted table of professionals. Or maybe it was picking up the burning white-hot urn with your forearms and carrying it to the gates of the dojo. Or maybe he offered me one of two pills in his hands&#x2014;one blue, one red. I don&#x2019;t recall that with great accuracy; the endless training has that effect on your mind. But whatever the process, it worked. I emerged a comics professional, trained for the very first time&#x2014;once again.<br><br> I joke about the Zen mysticism of the whole process, but in truth, there is much seriousness to it all. I learned a great deal at the hands of my mentor, Carl. The years working with him set the baseline and foundation for much of my work even as I experimented, grew, and broke the very rules I was initially taught. Because the final lesson for all things creative is written thusly: Just because it works for you, that doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s the only way of doing something. And I think that was Carl&#x2019;s ultimate lesson imparted to me and one that is triply clear in this fantastic book you hold in your hands. There are rules and lessons to be learned, but comics are called art for a reason. The subjectivity of it is as clear and true as its objectivity, and that relationship is explored and demonstrated clearly in the chapters ahead.<br> <br>What took me years to learn can now be yours to enjoy in mere days. May your own journey in the deep, dark void be short and sweet.<br> <br>Jim Lee<br> Burbank, California</p><h2>North of Hope</h2><p>"Hassler's brilliance has always been his ability to achieve the depth of real literature through such sure-handed, no-gimmicks, honest language that the result appears effortless."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW<br>After more than twenty years in the priesthood, Father Frank Healy is going home.

Since she had never known her mother, she had never felt the loss, or at least had not felt it as a change in her life. It was simply the way things were. Other children had mothers to take care of them and scold them and dress them and whack them and tell them stories; Rebekah had her nurse, her cousin Deborah, fifteen years older than her. <br>Deborah never yelled at Rebekah or spanked her, but that was because of Deborah's native cheerfulness, not because Rebekah never needed scolding. By the time Rebekah was five, she came to understand that Deborah was simple. She did not understand many of the things that happened around her, could not grasp many of Rebekah's questions and explanations. Rebekah did not love her any the less; indeed, she appreciated all the more how hard Deborah worked to learn all the tasks she did for her. For answers and understanding, she would talk to her father, or to her older brother Laban. For comfort and kindness she could always count on Deborah. <br>Rebekah no longer played pranks or hid or teased Deborah, because she could not bear seeing her nurse's confusion when a prank was discovered. Rebekah soon made her brother Laban stop teasing Deborah. "It's not fair to fool her," said Rebekah, which made little impression on Laban. What convinced him was when Rebekah said, "It's what a coward does, to mock someone who can't fight back." As usual, when she finally found the right words to say, Rebekah was able to prevail over her older brother. <br>The real change in her life, the one that transformed Rebekah's childhood, was when her father, Bethuel, went deaf. He had not been a young man when she was born, but he was strong enough to carry her everywhere on his shoulders when she was little, letting her listen in on conversations with the men and women of his household, shepherds and farmers and craftsmen, cooks and spinners and weavers. Riding on his shoulders as she did, his voice became far more than words to her. It was a vibration through her whole body; she felt sometimes as though she could hear his voice in her knees and elbows, and when he shouted she felt as if it were her own voice, coming from her own chest, deep, manly tones pouring out of her own throat. Sometimes she resented the fact that in order to say her own words, she had only her small high voice, which sounded silly and inconsequential even to her. <br>But when she spoke, Father heard her, and since he was the most important man in the whole world, however weak her voice might be, it was strong enough. Even after she grew too big to ride his shoulders, she was at his side as much as possible, listening to everything, understanding or trying to understand every aspect of the life of the camp, the work and workings of the household. He, in turn, called her his conscience. The little voice always at his side, never intruding, but asking him wise questions whenever they were alone together. <br>And then, trying to keep a cart from sliding down a muddy bank into the cold water of a brook in spring flood, Father slipped himself and fell into the water, the cart tumbling after him. The men swore later that it was a gift of God that Bethuel was not killed, for the cart was held up by the spokes of its own broken wheel just enough that he was able to keep his mouth above water and breathe while the men hurriedly unloaded the cart enough that they could lift it off him. He seemed at first to be no worse the wear for the hour he spent in the cold water, but that night he awoke shivering and fevered, and for two weeks he came back and forth between fever and chills as if the icy water still had a place in him. <br>When he rose at last from his pallet, the world had gone silent for him. He shouted everything he said, and heard no one's answer, and when Rebekah ran to him and covered her ears and cried, "Father, why are you angry with me?" he bent down to her and shouted for her to speak up, speak up, he couldn't hear her. Louder and louder she spoke until she was red-faced with screaming and Father gathered her into his arms and wept. "Of all the sounds that I shall never hear again," he murmured into her hair, "the voice of my sweet girl is the one I will miss most of all." <br>Father remained master of his household, but there was no more ranging out in the hills to oversee the herds. There was too much danger to a man who could not hear a shouted warning, or the roar of a lion, or the cries of marauders. Instead, Father had no choice but to trust his servants to oversee his flocks and herds. It embarrassed him to have to ask people to repeat everything, to talk slowly, to pronounce their words carefully so he could try to read their lips. He did not have to tell Rebekah that she could not stay with him all the time that he was in camp, as she had used to. She could see that he did not want her there, partly because he was ashamed to show his weakness in front of her, and partly because, when she spoke to him, she saw how much it hurt him that he could not hear her anymore. <br>"Why don't you go with your father?" Deborah asked her. "He likes you beside him. He used to carry you when you were little. You're too big now." <br>Rebekah had to explain it to her several times. "Father is deaf now. That means he can't hear. So I can't talk to him anymore. He doesn't hear me." <br>And after a little while, Deborah understood and remembered. Indeed, she took to informing Rebekah. "You mustn't go to your father today. He's deaf, you know. He can't hear you when you talk to him." Rebekah didn't have the heart to rebuke Deborah for the frequent reminders. Instead, she would ask Deborah to sing her a song as she plaited Rebekah's hair or spun thread beside her or walked through the camp, looking at the work of the women and children and old men. Everyone looked up when Deborah came singing, and gave her a smile. And they smiled at Rebekah, too, and answered her questions, until she understood everything she saw going on, all the work of Father's household. <br>Rebekah was ten years old when Father lost his hearing, and her brother Laban was twelve. It was just as hard on him as it was on her, for as she had been Father's constant companion in the camp, Laban had been his shadow on almost every trip to visit distant flocks and herds where they grazed. <br>To Laban it was like a prison, always to be in camp because his father rarely traveled. And Rebekah was no happier. Once she would have rejoiced to have Father always near the home tents, but he was short-tempered now, and bellowed often for no good reason. <br>Everyone was ill at ease. But the work of the household went on, day after day, week after week. People get used to anything, if it just goes on. Rebekah didn't like the way things were, but she expected this new order to go on unchanged. <br>Until, a year after her father's deafness began, she happened to come up behind several of the servant women boiling rags, and overheard them talking about Father. <br>"He's an old lion, with all that roaring." <br>"A lion with no teeth." <br>And they started to laugh until one of them noticed Rebekah and shushed the others. <br>Rebekah told this to Laban, and at first he was all for telling Father. But Rebekah clutched at Laban and held him back. "How will you even tell him? And if you make him understand, then what? Should he beat the woman for saying it? Or the others for laughing? Will that make them love him better?" <br>Laban looked at her. "We can't let them laugh at Father behind his back. Soon they'll laugh in his face, and then they'll do what they want. Already the servants don't even try to tell Father half the things that happen. Pillel makes decisions all by himself that he used to never make, and Father knows it but what can he do?" <br>"We can pray to God for him to hear again," said Rebekah. <br>"And what if God answers us the way he answered Abram and Sarai when they prayed for a son? Can Father wait ten years? Twenty? Thirty?" <br>They knew well the tales of their father's uncle Abraham, the great lord of the desert, the prophet that Pharaoh could not kill, and how his wife Sarah bore him a baby in her old age. <br>"But what else can we do?" said Rebekah. "Only God can let Father hear again." <br>"We can be his ears," said Laban. " <i>We</i> have time to explain things to him. Let the men tell us, and <i>we'll</i> tell Father." <br>Rebekah had her doubts about this. She had tried talking to Father many times, speaking slowly so he could read her lips, and at first he had tried to understand her, but most of the time he failed, or got it only partly right, and the resignation in his eyes when he looked away from her and refused to try anymore made her so sad she couldn't even cry. "What, you'll press your mouth into his ear and scream?" <br>Laban rolled his eyes as if she were a hopeless simpleton. "Writing." <br>"That's a thing for city priests." <br>"Uncle Abraham writes." <br>"Uncle Abraham is far away and very old and spends all his time talking to God," said Rebekah. <br>"If the priests in the city can write, and Uncle Abraham can write, then why can't Father and I learn to write?" <br>"Then I can, too," said Rebekah, daring him to argue with her. <br>"Of course you can," said Laban. "You have to. Because as soon as I can, I'll be out with the men, and you'll have to be able to talk to Father, too." <br>For three days, Laban and Rebekah spent every spare moment together, working out a set of pictures they could draw with a stick in the dirt. Some of the words were easy--each of the animals could be drawn quickly, as could crops, articles of clothing, pots, baskets. Day and night were easy enough, too--the sun was round, the moon a crescent. Water was a bit more of a challenge, but they ended up with a drawing of a well. <br>"What if you want to say 'well'?" asked Rebekah. <br>"Then I'll draw a well," said Laban. <br>"What if you want to say, 'There's no water in the well'?" asked Rebekah. <br>"Then I'll draw a well, point to it, and then rub it out!" Laban was beginn...</p><h2>The Art of Readable Writing: With the Flesch Readability Formula</h2><p>Describes a practical writing formula that uses contemporary language and rules of grammar</p><p></p><h2>Experience and Judgment (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)</h2><p>In <i>Experience and Judgment, </i>Husserl explores the problems of contemporary philosophy of language and the constitution of logical forms.

Now, in her own moving words, the woman behind the myth is revealed. The result is a captivating self-portrait of one of this century's most fascinating artists, an Aretha Franklin as real as the songs she sings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>For the first time anywhere, Aretha tells her story--the glorious triumphs as well as the heartbreaking pain. With refreshing candor, Aretha tells it like it is, the way she sees it, the way she lived it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A child prodigy of the golden age of gospel, the daughter of a world-famous preacher, Aretha was the anointed successor to Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward. But her father had a broader vision and helped Aretha enter the field of pop and jazz. By age eighteen, she was under contract to Columbia Records. Six years later, after only a few minor hits, she switched to Atlantic, where she shook the musical world to its roots. Her song "Respect" became the anthem of an epoch, a touchstone for African Americans, for women, for all people struggling to be free. Aretha became the Queen of Soul, the genre's finest interpreter since Ray Charles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In <b>Aretha: From These Roots</b>, the singer gets up-close and personal. In rich detail, she paints a vivid picture of a Detroit long gone: the storefront churches, the basement parties, the explosive R&amp;B shows. She documents her life as a single teenage mother, working to balance home life with career, coping with two challenging marriages and, later, romantic relationships that were the source of both tremendous joy and unforeseen heartache.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Along the way, we meet the characters who lit up her life: her charismatic father, the Reverend C. L. Franklin, "the man with the million-dollar voice"; Sam Cooke, the man of her dreams; her singing sisters, Erma and Carolyn, and her manager-brother, Cecil; her famous colleagues--Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Luther Vandross, and Luciano Pavarotti--as well as some famous rivals. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Aretha emerges as a triumphant woman of rare wit, willing to share with us her passion for great music, great food, and great love affairs. Her book does more than illuminate some of the most exciting songs ever sung; it lets you into the heart and mind of the mesmerizing woman who sang them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the soul-baring performances that have drawn listeners to her for four decades, Aretha Franklin is a bit cagey when it comes to discussing her personal life in her autobiography, <i>From These Roots</i>. The famously press-shy Aretha is a free-speaking anecdote spinner and a blunt sharer of opinions of coworkers and fellow artists. (Don't get her started on Natalie Cole.) But some areas remain blurry; for instance, her troubled first marriage to a temperamental music-business figure named Ted White is covered in only a tiny handful of pages. Other happier memories of lovers and of her late father, the famed minister Rev. C.L. Franklin, find her in a more expansive mood. Most consistently indelible in this telling, though, is her musical story. Born in 1942, she grew up around some of the century's greatest singers--Clara Ward, Dinah Washington, and Sam Cooke were all family friends. A voice that many consider the world's finest, a strikingly individual touch on piano, and an eclectic ear for material combined to make her a notable artist who moved quickly from the gospel circuit to Columbia Records and moderate success in a variety of contexts, from show tunes to a gritty tribute to Washington. Her reminiscences of those days, and of the conquests that followed when she moved to the forefront of the soul revolution after signing to Atlantic, are obviously still fresh for her. A formidable presence even in her 20s, Aretha continues to be a daunting figure. While <i>From These Roots</i> isn't as splashy a triumph as her 1967 Atlantic debut or her house-rocking at the 1998 Grammys with a rendition of Puccini's "<i>Nessun dorma</i>," the book does make for an irresistible reflection on a singular woman and her art. <i>--Rickey Wright</i><b>Aretha Franklin</b> has won more Grammys--fifteen--than any female in history and was granted the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award.

Drawing on years of groundbreaking research, Jean Pfaelzer reveals how, beginning in 1848, lawless citizens and duplicitous politicians purged dozens of communities of thousands of Chinese residents&#x2013;and how the victims bravely fought back. <br>In town after town, as races and classes were pitted against one another in the raw and anarchistic West, Chinese miners and merchants, lumberjacks and field workers, prostitutes and merchants&#x2019; wives, were gathered up at gunpoint and marched out of town, sometimes thrown into railroad cars along the very tracks they had built.<br><br>Here, in vivid detail, are unforgettable incidents such as the torching of the Chinatown in Antioch, California, after Chinese prostitutes were accused of giving seven young men syphilis, and a series of lynchings in Los Angeles bizarrely provoked by a Chinese wedding. From the port of Seattle to the mining towns in California&#x2019;s Siskiyou Mountains to &#x201c;Nigger Alley&#x201d; in Los Angeles, the first Chinese Americans were hanged, purged, and banished. Chinatowns across the West were burned to the ground. <br><br>But the Chinese fought back: They filed the first lawsuits for reparations in the United States, sued for the restoration of their property, prosecuted white vigilantes, demanded the right to own land, and, years before Brown v. Board of Education<i>,</i> won access to public education for their children. Chinese Americans organized strikes and vegetable boycotts in order to starve out towns that tried to expel them. They ordered arms from China and, with Winchester rifles and Colt revolvers, defended themselves. In 1893, more than 100,000 Chinese Americans refused the government&#x2019;s order to wear photo identity cards to prove their legal status&#x2013;the largest mass civil disobedience in United States history to that point. <br><br><i>Driven Out</i> features riveting characters, both heroic and villainous, white and Asian. Charles McGlashen, a newspaper editor, spearheaded a shift in the tactics of persecution, from brutality to legal boycotts of the Chinese, in order to mount a run for governor of California. Fred Bee, a creator of the Pony Express, became the Chinese consul and one of the few attorneys willing to defend the Chinese. Lum May, a dry goods store owner, saw his wife dragged from their home and driven insane. President Grover Cleveland, hoping that China&#x2019;s 400,000 subjects would buy the United States out of its economic crisis, persuaded China to abandon the overseas Chinese in return for a trade treaty. Quen Hing Tong, a merchant, sought an injunction against the city of San Jose in an important precursor to today&#x2019;s suits against racial profiling and police brutality. <br><br>In <i>Driven Out</i>, Jean Pfaelzer sheds a harsh light on America&#x2019;s past.

Jean Pfaelzer documents hundreds of cases in which the Chinese were lynched, maimed, burned out of their neighborhoods, and forced at gunpoint to leave mining camps, small villages, Indian reservations, and Chinatowns. The methodical and ruthless nature of this ethnic cleansing was matched only by the resistance from the Chinese &#x2014; sometimes with guns and knives or fists and sometimes with savvy recourse to their government representatives as well as petitions, public confrontations, and hundreds of lawsuits using white attorneys up to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pfaelzer has names and stories for these incidents &#x2014; making the actors real and accessible.

Among his many publications in English are From Tradition to Gospel (1934), Gospel Criticism and Christology (1935), A Fresh Approach to the New Testament and Early Christian Literature (1936), The Sermon on the Mount (1940), Jesus (1949), Paul (1953), The Pastoral Epistles (Hermeneia; Fortress Press, 1972), and James (Hermeneia; Fortress Press, 1976).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Lost Tools of Learning and the Mind of the Maker (Paperback)</h2><p>This is a single volume containing &#34;The Lost Tools of Learning&#34; and &#34;The Mind of the Maker&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>Constantin Brancusi (Modern Masters Series)</h2><p>This volume in the Modern Masters series is an important and perceptive study of the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, whose arresting forms have exerted a powerful impact on the art of this century. By incisively evaluating the diverse influences that channeled into the artist's work &#x2014; including his academic training and brief apprenticeship with Auguste Rodin, the folk art and architecture of his native Romania, Cubism, and African art &#x2014; Eric Shanes has produced an insightful study that reveals how this complex artist achieved the expressive simplicity of his innovative sculptures. <br> <br>An extensive "Notes on Technique" section, illustrated with evocative views of the artist's studio, illuminates Brancusi's methods of working in all media, including photography, which he used to record his own ideas about how his sculpture should be seen. The many photographs by Brancusi are complemented by sensitive color illustrations that capture the essence of his art. Written with a clarity of prose that well serves the clarity of the sculptor's own work, this much-needed book presents the fascinating story of a profoundly influential artist.<br> <br> <b>About the Modern Masters series:<br> <br> </b>With informative, enjoyable texts and over 100 illustrations &#x2014; approximately 48 in full color &#x2014; this innovative series offers a fresh look at the most creative and influential artists of the postwar era. The authors are highly respected art historians and critics chosen for their ability to think clearly and write well. Each handsomely designed volume presents a thorough survey of the artist's life and work, as well as statements by the artist, an illustrated chapter on technique, a chronology, lists of exhibitions and public collections, an annotated bibliography, and an index. Every art lover, from the casual museumgoer to the serious student, teacher, critic, or curator, will be eager to collect these Modern Masters.

To answer that and related questions concerning the art of Constantin Brancusi, as well as to give a short account of the sculptor&#x2019;s life, is the primary purpose of this book. Yet the book enjoys a second, more fundamental aim as well.<br> <br>Brancusi is widely accepted as the most important and original sculptor of this century, and his work exemplifies the new responsiveness to form and materials that was central to the modernist aesthetic. He was regarded as a major figure by such leading members of the avant-garde as Guillaume Apollinaire, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp, Julio Gonzalez, Kurt Schwitters, Man Ray, Piet Mondrian, Amedeo Modigliani, Francis Picabia, Erik Satie, James Joyce, Tristan Tzara, and Ezra Pound (who wrote an important essay on him in 1921). His work appealed to diverse tastes within modernism, being hailed both by the Dadaists, who eschewed rationalism in art, and by members of De Stijl, who extolled it. He also influenced a great many modern sculptors and painters, including Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Fernand Leger, and David Smith; and his ensemble at Tirgu-Jiu inspired several environmental sculptors, such as Christo and Walter De Maria.<br> <br>Paradoxically, the view of Brancusi as a leading member of the modern movement has tended to obscure rather than clarify his artistic aims. Brancusi has long been hailed as an abstract sculptor by nonrepresentational artists and by writers favoring abstract art, who have frequently rejected the symbolic and metaphorical meanings of his sculptures because they would detract from the status of the works as purely abstract objects. Even those meanings supplied by the sculptor himself have often been ignored. Instead, it has been asserted that Brancusi really wanted to be a wholly abstract artist but, lacking the courage to do so, he cloaked his pure abstractions in symbolic meaning. Yet the sculptor frequently and vehemently denied that his work was at all abstract. He held that it represented a level of existence beyond everyday appearances, and it was in order to address that reality that he employed allegory and symbolism.<br> <br>Another oft-encountered misconception is the notion that Brancusi&#x2019;s passing interest in African carving during the mid-1910s made him a primitive&#x201d; artists and that African art was the most important influence in Brancusi&#x2019;s career.&#x201d; Such a view, which has been propounded by a great many Western writers, ignores the fact that the formal influence of African carving on Brancusi&#x2019;s work became apparent only about 1913 some six years after the sculptor had struck out in a completely new artistic and aesthetic direction with <i>The Prayer</i> of 1907. The apprehension of Brancusi himself as a primitive is totally contradicted by the extent of his academic training and by the formal sophistication of the majority of his work.<br> <br>Such misconceptions are linked to conflicting artistic and political ideologies. Brancusi was undoubtedly committed to modernism, but his commitment has been misinterpreted as an exclusive one: while it is permissible for a modernist to have embraced African primitivism,&#x201d; as Picasso, Georges Braque, and a great many others did, some leading Western writers have not accepted Romanian primitivism&#x201d; as an equally potent influence on Brancusi. Instead, they claim that he turned his back on the visual and folkloric traditions of his native Romania by choosing to live in Paris for the major part of his career. As a counter to this Western bias, some nationalist Romanian writers on Brancusi have asserted that he was influenced by Romanian traditions to the exclusion of all others, which is equally untrue. All these misconceptions have resulted in multiple, mutually exclusive views of Brancusi: as a sculptor whose highly abstract works contain no meanings other than purely formal ones; as an abstractionist who cloaked his works in factitious meanings; as a primitivistic sculptor; as a sculptor who cut himself off from his Romanian origins; and as a sculptor who cut himself off from anything but those origins.<br> <br>As is usual with such disputes, the fact of the matter lies somewhere in the middle: Brancusi was as responsive to the folk traditions of his homeland as he was to the demands of his own pioneering aesthetic. For a time after 1913 the sculptor was certainly influenced by the forms (though not the content) of African carving; but throughout his life he also maintained and developed a wide repertory of forms that were derived from Romanian folk art and architecture, as well as from the other Slavonic, Egyptian, Buddhist, and Cycladic sculptural traditions. Although he lived in Paris rather than Romania for a variety of cultural and economic reasons, until the late 1940s he always maintained his connections with his country of origin and, indeed, created his greatest work there in 1937 38.<br> <br>The deeper aim of this book is to offer an appraisal of Brancusi&#x2019;s work that takes its cue from the sculptor&#x2019;s own frequent statements concerning his art, most particularly those touching upon the working philosophy&#x201d; that compelled him. It respects his view that his work was not abstract and seeks to illuminate what he was attempting to express. His meanings were never afterthoughts appended to his sculptures; for the most party, they generated the forms of his works. The diverse influences on Brancusi are examined here within the framework of the associative thinking that was integral to his art, and thus the true significance of those influences may become clearer.<br> <br>This book differs from the previous Brancusi literature in one other important respect: departures from a strictly chronological narrative of the sculptor&#x2019;s life have been made in order to trace an essential creative process. Throughout his maturity Brancusi worked simultaneously on series of sculptures with different themes. For example, he made twenty-eight marble and bronze sculptures of birds over a period of nearly forty years. When these are divorced from one another and examined amid the works in other series made during the same period, the clear formal and thematic links within a series, and from series to series, can be obscured. It is hoped that by departing from a chronological approach in order to track each series, a more revealing account of the most coherent body of twentieth-century sculpture will emerge.<br></p><h2>Landscape Painting In Watercolor</h2><p>This classic is by Zoltan Szabo, one of the greats at transparent watercolor painting.

Reprint.</p><p>Dana Stabenow is the Edgar Award-winning author of Fire and Ice, So Sure of Death, and several other acclaimed mysteries. She lives in Anchorage, Alaska.Stabenow's second Liam Campbell mystery (after Fire and Ice) has the vivid descriptions, rich characterization and compelling plot that distinguish her nine Kate Shugak books, with the added advantage of extra sex appeal. Alaska State Trooper Campbell, stationed in the southwest Alaska boondocks, has a lot on his plate: an eager new trooper, Diana Prince; a visit from his estranged father, an air force colonel on a suspicious mission; the reappearance of his great love, charter pilot Wyanet (Wy) Chouinard; and two very different cases rife with false clues. When an assistant at an important archeological site is murdered, evidence points to Frank Petla, a Yupik grave robber who travels by four-wheeler. Liam apprehends him in a dramatic chase by leaping out of Wy's Cub into a lake, but later comes to believe Frank's profession of innocence. The desperate murderer finally reveals himself, almost killing Wy and her journalist friend Jo. Finding a killer who sets fire to a fishing boat, incinerating all seven people aboard, proves a more difficult task. Initially, Liam suspects a disgruntled former deckhand, but the solution hinges on careful observation and an understanding of Yupik lifestyles and traditions, a necessity for these white cops in a predominantly Native American population. Colorful characters abound, and Stabenow ably evokes the life of hard-pressed commercial fishermen. The mystery ends on a mystical note, integrating Native American belief into a satisfying conclusion.

Should I be anything else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Raymond Chandler<br><br>Some time ago I had a lengthy telephone conversation with a man I&#x2019;ll call David. I&#x2019;d known him nearly forty years earlier at the University of Arizona, where we shared a fiction workshop taught by the writer Robert C. S. Downs, who encouraged both of us, but David especially. At the time I was finishing up my PhD in American literature, so when I asked Downs about taking a workshop, I assumed he&#x2019;d put me in one at the graduate level, but he didn&#x2019;t. My prose, he explained, was full of jargon and intellectual pretension. Most writers had about a thousand pages of shitty prose in them, he went on, and these have to be expelled before they can hope to write seriously. &#x201c;In your case,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;make it two thousand.&#x201d; And so, pushing thirty, I swallowed my pride and enrolled in a workshop full of twenty-year-olds, many of whom were better writers than I was.<br><br>David was working on a novel about a rock-and-roll band, and having once played in a band myself, I was envious of both his subject matter and his bold talent and even more jealous of the fact that at age twenty he&#x2019;d already figured out what he wanted to do with his life, whereas I&#x2019;d wasted the better part of a decade pursuing an advanced degree I no longer really wanted. What I didn&#x2019;t know about David was what a rough time he was having outside the classroom. His mother, whom he&#x2019;d dearly loved, had recently died of cancer, and his father was an emotional tyrant. David himself had very little money and was drinking heavily. Indeed, the fiction workshop&#x2014;his dream of becoming a novelist one day&#x2014;was just about all that was holding him together. Then, near the end of the semester, he got in trouble, courtesy of his poet girlfriend. She&#x2019;d been assigned six poems, and the day before they were due she hadn&#x2019;t written a single line. When she told David she was thinking about dropping the course, he said, &#x201c;Nonsense. We&#x2019;ll write them now. How hard can it be?&#x201d; So they sat down and did just that, the girlfriend writing three poems, David the other three.<br><br>They both thought the results were pretty good, but the girlfriend was unprepared for the praise lavished on the poems, in particular the one David had written about his mother. After class, she made the mistake of confiding to a classmate that all of the poems had been written the night before, half of them by her boyfriend. When her friend reported the infraction, both she and David were hauled before Downs, the director of creative writing, to explain themselves. The girlfriend arrived at the meeting determined to defend the work as her own. David, they agreed beforehand, would admit only to offering advice. But this wasn&#x2019;t Downs&#x2019;s first experience with academic dishonesty, and instead of asking if she&#x2019;d written the poems in question, he quoted the best line from the whole batch of poems and asked if she&#x2019;d written it; she immediately broke down.<br><br>Since she&#x2019;d come clean and it was her first offense, Downs said he&#x2019;d recommend a D in the course but no mark on her record. He then turned to his star fiction writer and said, &#x201c;Good poems.&#x201d; David sighed, accepting the compliment, proud to have written the line that his mentor so admired, but fearful of what came next. The dishonesty charge was the least of it, he confessed. He was out of money and about to be evicted from the shithole where he was living. He&#x2019;d dropped the rest of his courses earlier in the term, and though he hated the idea, there was nothing to do but return home in defeat. He hadn&#x2019;t intended to tell Downs any of this, but there he was, spilling his guts about how much the workshop meant to him and how much he hated the idea of not completing it. When he asked what his grade would be, Downs said he&#x2019;d be getting the A he&#x2019;d earned and added, perhaps to bolster his spirits, that it would likely be the only one in the class. Apparently we were not a stellar group. &#x201c;What about Rick?&#x201d; David asked. After all, I was a grad student. Downs shrugged. &#x201c;Rick doesn&#x2019;t want to be a writer. He wants to be a teacher.&#x201d; (He was wrong about that, but he couldn&#x2019;t have known. After getting the PhD, I did plan on applying for teaching positions.)<br><br>Now fast-forward to 2002. For both David and me a lot has happened. He&#x2019;s eventually finished his undergraduate degree, then gone on to graduate school for an MFA in poetry, not fiction. He has married, had kids, is teaching college to support his writing habit and has become middle-aged. He&#x2019;s continued to struggle periodically with alcohol but remained functional, enjoyed success as a poet and become something of a legend among his students. Along the way he&#x2019;s finished that rock-and-roll novel, but frustrated by his inability to find an agent, finally published it himself. Maybe his life isn&#x2019;t the one he imagined back in Tucson, but for the most part he&#x2019;s been pretty happy.<br><br>Until one day he picks up the University of Arizona alumni magazine and discovers that a student from his undergraduate workshop (who did indeed get a B) has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. According to the article, the prizewinner taught for a while before quitting to write full-time. David feels something inside him come untethered&#x2014;and really, who could blame him? Somehow he and I have swapped destinies. He is the teacher, I the writer. He wants someone to explain the cosmic mechanism by which such a cruel joke could be perpetrated. In fact, he&#x2019;d like me to explain.<br><br>As if I&#x2019;d know.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve written a lot about destiny in my fiction, not because I understand it, but because I&#x2019;d like to. If David was puzzled by the narrative arc of our lives, he wasn&#x2019;t alone. At the risk of sounding falsely modest, I have to say I&#x2019;m not aware of anyone&#x2014;teacher, family member, friend&#x2014;who predicted anything like the great good fortune that has befallen me in the writing career that I came to fairly late. Some years ago I ran into an old girlfriend who said she&#x2019;d been following my work with both pleasure and mystification. &#x201c;I always thought you were a nice enough guy,&#x201d; she told me, clearly trying to puzzle it through and not wanting to hurt my feelings, &#x201c;but I never dreamed you had books in you.&#x201d; I know exactly how she felt. I can&#x2019;t explain it even now. Anyone who&#x2019;s interested in my early life can have a look at my memoir Elsewhere, though for the purposes of this discussion a thumbnail sketch will suffice. I lived the first eighteen years of my life in Gloversville, a poor mill town in upstate New York. Raised Catholic, I was for many years an altar boy. My parents separated when I was a kid, so I was brought up by my nervous mother, who hated where we lived, and by my grandparents, who owned the house we lived in. If my mother was adamant about anything, it was that, as an American, I could be whatever I wanted to be. That I was as good as anybody. I was always to remember this in case anyone had the temerity to suggest otherwise.<br><br>My mostly absent father had come to a whole different set of conclusions. He was part of the Normandy invasion and returned from the war with a personal philosophy that fit neatly onto his favorite coffee mug, which I still have: here&#x2019;s to you as good as you are and here&#x2019;s to me, as bad as i am, but as good as you are and as bad as i am, i&#x2019;m as good as you are, as bad as i am. It was, now that I think about it, the joke version of my mother&#x2019;s mantra, and to complete this gag the mug&#x2019;s handle was on the inside of the cylinder. Call it an object lesson: that being as good as anybody might not be of much use if you had to go through life with a basic design flaw. For my father, being born poor was just such a flaw. Having a name that ended in a vowel was another.<br><br>But never mind, my mother said. In addition to America, she believed in education and its ability to negate any of these flaws. My high school was tiny, and without expending much effort I flourished there. I had enough of my father&#x2019;s easy charm to talk most people into giving me what I wanted; and on the others I could employ my mother&#x2019;s tidal persistence, her innate ability to nick away at people until they gave me what I was after, just to be rid of me. The University of Arizona was twice the size of my hometown, though, and what a rude awakening that was. My first day there I went to the registrar&#x2019;s office, hoping to do something out of sequence, probably register early for classes, and was met by a grim woman who sized me up at a glance. Holding up a hand to stop me midexplanation, she said, &#x201c;Have you matriculated?&#x201d; The question stopped me cold. I didn&#x2019;t want to admit I had no idea what the word meant. Her tone made it sound rather personal, almost sexual, but that couldn&#x2019;t be, could it? I had a fifty-fifty chance of being right, though, so I said no, not recently, but I was willing to if it was strictly necessary. Tomorrow, I was told sternly. I was a freshman and would matriculate with the rest of my class tomorrow and not before. What I was asking for, she explained, was special treatment, and I wasn&#x2019;t going to get it, not from her.<br><br>My roommate that first semester was a boy from a tiny Arizona mining town that he was clearly homesick for already, less than twenty-four hours after leaving it. He couldn&#x2019;t tell me enough about the place, which was apparently perfect in every respect. He seemed to have little interest in his classes, and as the semester wore on he had a devil of a time making friends. He wanted to pledge a fraternity, but none would have him. Back home he had a girlfriend, but at the university the girls he asked out gave him the once-over and said no in a way that made him understand he was wrong to have asked. At first he did poorly in his classes, which seemed to surprise him, but then he did worse; finally the dean of students requested an interview, at which it was decided that he&#x2019;d be happier at a junior college closer to home. I was glad when he left and not just because it meant I&#x2019;d have our room to myself for the rest of the term; in the brief time we&#x2019;d shared it, I&#x2019;d come to loathe him viscerally, though at the time I didn&#x2019;t understand why. Now it couldn&#x2019;t be clearer. Looking at him, his face alive with angry zits, was like looking in the mirror.<br><br>And so, badly shaken and far from home, I set about developing a strategy for surviving at an institution determined to make me understand while I might be as good as anybody, I was certainly no better. The gist of my plan was this: I would (1) pretend to know things I didn&#x2019;t rather than risk the humiliation of ignorance and (2) conceal, as far as humanly possible, who I was and where I came from. I&#x2019;d figure out what I was supposed to like and admire, and would do so even when I didn&#x2019;t. In other words, I would lie through my teeth about everything. Fortunately, I wasn&#x2019;t the only liar there. College is, after all, where we go to reinvent ourselves, to sever our ties with the past, to become the person we always wanted to be and were prevented from being by people who knew better. Actually, none of this is quite as bad as it sounds. Many years later, giving a commencement address at the college where my younger daughter was graduating, I would compare going to college to entering the witness-protection program. You&#x2019;re supposed to try on a new identity or two. Indeed, it would not only defeat the purpose, it would be downright dangerous to leave the program easily recognizable as the person who&#x2019;d entered it.<br><br>Anyway, I changed. I took my classes more seriously than I&#x2019;d done in high school, not out of any abstract love of learning but rather because the competition was stiffer, and I figured the more I actually knew, the less I&#x2019;d have to pretend to know. I ditched all the &#x201c;stylish&#x201d; clothes I&#x2019;d brought with me from the East and dressed in western jeans with button flies. I had to be taught that these worked better if you buttoned from the bottom up, not from the top down. There was a lot to learn, but I was gradually able to blend in. When asked where I was from, I substituted &#x201c;upstate New York&#x201d; for &#x201c;Gloversville,&#x201d; a deft maneuver that allowed me to trade embarrassment over my origins, a new experience, for guilt, which, having been raised Catholic, I was used to. Summers, when I returned to Gloversville to work road construction with my father, were the toughest. Because in truth I was very happy to be back home and living in the house where I&#x2019;d grown up, where people knew the old me. I hadn&#x2019;t realized just how much I loved my grandparents until I saw them again that first summer, and in their company I felt the sting of my dogged efforts at reinvention out west. I began to understand that in denying where I was from, I was also denying them and the many sacrifices they&#x2019;d made for my mother and me.<br><br>I&#x2019;d made my choice, though, and there was no going back. I was becoming someone else. Someone better. However high the cost, I&#x2019;d pay it.</p><h2>Knowledge of the Higher Worlds: How Is It Achieved? (CW 10)</h2><p>Rudolf Steiner's foundational handbook for spiritual and personal development has grown more modern with time, though his methods remain clearly distinguishable from many current paths of inner work. First, Steiner's method is based on the clarity of thought normally associated with scientific research. Instead of denying clear thinking, his aim is to extend it beyond its present limitations. Second, Steiner recognizes&#x2015;as do all genuine paths&#x2015;that the way to spiritual experience is arduous and dangerous and calls for self-control in thought, word, and action. The human being comprises a unity, and we cannot develop knowledge without a corresponding development of feeling and will. <br><br>Steiner predicted that humanity would begin to experience a longing for forms of experience that transcended intellectual, materialistic thinking. More than a hundred years after the first publication of this book, countless means are offered for achieving transcendental experience, including Eastern meditation practices, channeling, remote viewing, and astral projection. Moreover, there has been a huge increase in the number of people who report various suprasensory perceptions, such as near-death experiences and meetings with angels. In this context, Steiner's key spiritual guidebook is needed more than ever, given its unique, precise instructions for inner training, its protective exercises, and its indications for staying grounded and centered. <i><b>Knowledge of the Higher Worlds</b></i> begins with the preconditions for personal development and guides the reader through the stages of initiation, its practical aspects, and its effects.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Faith and Film: Theological Themes at the Cinema</h2><p>Bryan Stone engages the cinema to open a discussion of theology and the culture of our time by pairing specific Christian doctrines found in the Apostles&#39; Creed with popular movies and videos.</p><p>Bryan Stone was born in San Diego, California and is currently the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the E.

("It's probably enough to say that in the Massachusetts Mt.

After serving ten years in prison for the crime, Sam Pulsifer moves on with his life, but the emergence of a copycat who's turning New England's literary landmarks to ash puts Sam back in the spotlight and on a quest for the truth.

A heartbreaking story about truth and honesty and the damage they do, it's above all a massive piece of entertainment that will make you think and make you care.</p><h2>Flashman: From the Flashman Papers, 1839-1842</h2><p>An American Book Club edition of the Flashman stories.</p><p>The author of the famous Flashman Papers and the Private McAuslan stories, George MacDonald Fraser has worked on newspapers in Britain and Canada. In addition to his novels he has also written numerous screenplays, most notably The Three Musketeers, The Four Musketeers, and the James Bond film, Octopussy.<i>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t wait to die on the field of honour. Heroes draw no higher wages than the others.&#x2019;</i> &#x2013; soldier of fortune Paolo di Avitabile in <i>Flashman</i><br><br>Just before World War I, Mark Franklin, the hero of George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s Mr American, travels to London, where he spends a bibulous evening with an elderly military man by the name of Sir Harry Paget Flashman. &#x2018;He had looked Sir Harry up in Who&#x2019;s Who and read incredulously through the succinct list of campaigns and decorations &#x2013; that gnarled old man sleeping there had seen Custer ride into the broken bluffs above the Little Big Horn, and fought hand to hand with Afghan tribesmen more than seventy years ago; he had ridden into the guns at Balaclava and seen the ranks form for Pickett&#x2019;s charge at Gettysburg; he had known Wellington and Lincoln . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Who wouldn&#x2019;t be incredulous? Sir Harry&#x2019;s numerous honors include not only England&#x2019;s Victoria Cross, but also the French Legion of Honour and the American Congressional Medal of Honor. His Who&#x2019;s Who entry &#x2013; should you ever happen upon it &#x2013; requires four inches of small type just to list some of his nearly unbelievable exploits. During the course of a long life, Sir Harry Paget Flashman (1822&#x2013;1915) served as a political adviser to Chancellor Bismarck on the Schleswig-Holstein question, briefly functioned as chief of staff to the Rajah of Sarawak, rode with both John Brown and Jeb Stuart, and even assisted the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as an aide-decamp. Over the years this far-ranging traveler also spent some time as a buffalo hunter, western scout, Australian prospector, &#x2018;reluctant deputy marshal to J. B. Hickok, Esq.,&#x2019; and native interpreter &#x2013; Sir Harry spoke nine languages fluently and could &#x2018;rub along&#x2019; in another dozen or so.<br><br>Naturally, Who&#x2019;s Who &#x2013; with British discretion &#x2013; barely hints that Harry Flashman frequently spied for Her Majesty&#x2019;s government and that he was mixed up in both the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad. Moreover, through a run of astonishing bad luck, the man seems to have landed smack in the middle of virtually every major battle or civil insurrection of the nineteenth century &#x2013; the Siege of Gandamack in Afghanistan, the Zulu attack at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift, the rising of the Mahdi at Khartoum, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Peking Rebellion of 1900. During the American Civil War he even inexplicably managed to serve as a major in the Union forces and a colonel in the army of the Confederacy.<br><br>As it happens, when Mr Franklin met Sir Harry the then 92- year-old general had recently completed his personal memoirs, memoirs so disturbing that after his death they were quickly sealed and, it would appear, instantly forgotten. Indeed, the memory of Sir Harry himself gradually faded away, so that otherwise reliable histories of the Victorian era failed to assign him even a footnote. But, then, in 1965 during a sale of household furniture at Ashby in Leicestershire, the manuscript miraculously resurfaced. Ably edited by George MacDonald Fraser, the so-called Flashman Papers were eventually published in twelve volumes, each &#x2018;packet&#x2019; focusing on one or more episodes from their author&#x2019;s martial career. They begin with the teenaged Flashman&#x2019;s expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness &#x2013; an incident mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x2019;s almost libelous Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days &#x2013; and follow him up to the unpleasantness, very late in his life, with Colonel Sebastian &#x2018;Tiger Jack&#x2019; Moran. That last name may be familiar, as Moran was once described by the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as &#x2018;the second most dangerous man in London&#x2019; and &#x2018;the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced&#x2019;.<br><br>But, really, what impropriety in these reminiscences could have offended the sensibilities of the Flashman family? The author was the most upright of eminent Victorians, the recipient of the San Serafino Order of Purity and Truth, the honorary president of the Mission for the Reclamation of Reduced Females, and the former governor of his alma mater, that bastion of muscular Christianity, Rugby School. Perhaps Sir Harry&#x2019;s family, in particular his clerical son, the Reverend<br>Bishop Harry Albert Victor Flashman, simply felt it wiser for posterity to honor a public career already well documented in Dawns and Departures of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life and &#x2019;Twixt Cossack and Cannon. Yet time has not been kind to these stiffly official memoirs. They are as forgotten now as if they had never existed, while great scholars and common readers alike return regularly to the Flashman Papers for instruction and delight. And, it goes without saying, for the irresistible brazen effrontery of the man himself. For in these memoirs, Sir Harry Flashman, the supposed Victorian equivalent of a &#x2018;parfit gentil knyght,&#x2019; reveals himself to be &#x2013; in his own words &#x2013; &#x2018;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward &#x2013; and, oh yes, a toady.&#x2019;<br><br>In fact, Flashman is one of the world&#x2019;s most entertaining and beguiling rogues. He pursues life&#x2019;s pleasures with Casanovian gusto, regularly employs the colorful language of the barracks, and knows that &#x2018;there isn&#x2019;t any folly a man won&#x2019;t contemplate if there&#x2019;s money or a woman at stake.&#x2019; With his gallant sidewhiskers, bold dark eyes with hooded lids, and strong, aquiline nose, this charming dastard &#x2013; fourteen stone of sheer manliness &#x2013; regularly seduces schoolgirls and queens, hides or runs away when fights break out, and manages, through deception and utter poltroonery, to survive when better men die. As he says (in Royal Flash): &#x2018;The ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead, God rest &#x2019;em, and you take the credit.&#x2019;<br><br>The three startling, even shocking adventures reprinted in this Everyman omnibus provide the ideal introduction to Sir Harry&#x2019;s rumbustious life. In Flashman the youthful anti-hero spends his last day at Rugby, enlists in the army, captures the heart (and body) of the fair-haired Elspeth, and reluctantly embarks on a mission to mountainous, war-torn Afghanistan. In Flash for Freedom! the luckless Flashy joins the crew of an African slave ship, unwillingly assists the Underground Railroad, and fortuitously meets a rising young American politician named Abraham Lincoln. (In later years, Lincoln was known to say: &#x2018;When all other trusts fail, turn to Flashman.&#x2019; I believe that the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; should be emphasized.) Finally, Flashman in the Great Game takes our man into the world of Kim, as he spies for the British, dallies with a luscious maharani, and desperately struggles to survive the blood-baths of the Sepoy Mutiny.<br><br>That he does so will hardly come as a surprise, nor that he emerges from his Indian nightmare not only alive but also elevated to a knighthood. Nevertheless, a few crudely unimaginative critics have suggested that nobody could actually have escaped from so many deadly ambushes and battles. Two or three have even gone so far as to speculate that George Mac-DonaldFraser is&nbsp; the&nbsp; author, not the editor, of the Flashman Papers, with the deeply cynical implication that Flashman himself is merely a character in a series of clever novels. Sigh. What can you expect these days from cloistered academics, none of whom is even half as alive as Flashman? Flashy may not be as admirable as, say, Don Quixote, Lord Greystoke or Sherlock Holmes, but he&#x2019;s certainly just as real.</p><h2>The Wagon Box Fight: An Episode of Red Cloud&#39;s War</h2><p>One of the most dramatic battles of the Indian Wars is described in a revised edition with new material including official army reports and recent archaeological evidence.</p><p>Jerry Keenan is recognized as one of the leading experts in Indian wars history.

Only the rescue turns into an abduction, and Rhapsody soon finds herself dragged along on an epic voyage, one that spans centuries and ranges across a wonder-filled fantasy world.<br></p><p><i>Rhapsody</i> is high fantasy, descended from Tolkien's <i>Lord of the Rings</i> through Eddings's Belgariad and Malloreon series, complete with an elf-like people, cannibalistic giants, fire-born demons, and dragons. Inquiring fantasy readers will wonder whether it can live up to such distinguished predecessors. The answer is yes. Haydon's first fantasy is a palpable hit. The three protagonists are well-realized characters whose adventures are by turns hilarious, horrific, and breathtaking. Best of all, though elements are drawn from familiar sources ranging from Norse myth to Mozart's <i>The Magic Flute</i>, Haydon's magic worldbuilding is convincing, consistent, and interesting. <p> Rhapsody, a young woman trained as a Namer, can attune herself to the vibrations of all things, tap the power of true names, and rename people, changing their basic identities.

If you have the right map, it will take you wherever you want to go," she tells her adoptive brothers. <i>They</i> are "the Brother," a professional assassin able to sense and track the heartbeats of all natives of the doomed Island of Seren, their homeland, and his giant sidekick Grunthor, a green-skinned Sergeant Major who enjoys making jokes, using edged weapons, and honing his cannibalistic palate. Inadvertently, Rhapsody has renamed the Brother Achmed the Snake, breaking his enslavement to Tsoltan the F'dor (a fire-born demon). Tsoltan sends minions in pursuit to rebind Achmed. The three escape into the roots of a World Tree, Sagia, emerging transformed into another country and century. But have they truly escaped the F'dor's evil? And how does all this relate to the prologue's story of Gwydion and Emily, two young lovers brought together across history and then separated by the mysterious Meridion?</p><p> Like most first volumes, <i>Rhapsody</i> contains a lot of background information and foreshadowing, though Haydon ties up numerous plot lines at the end. The dislocations in time can be confusing, and some readers may find that the very 1990s dialogue clashes with the epic storytelling of the descriptive passages. Overall, however, <i>Rhapsody</i> is a smashing debut that delivers hours of great reading and will have you impatient to read the rest of the series. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>"September marks the hardback debut of a great new fantasy talent. With RHAPSODY (4+), Elizabeth Haydon begins an epic saga worthy of Eddings, Goodkind and Jordan as the strands of time are twisted to bring two people together who would otherwise have never met. That encounter will reverberate through time and change everything. First, however, we must follow the adventures of a young woman who falls into the company of two mysterious strangers fleeing a deadly demon. Their journey will change her almost beyond recognition as she faces unspeakable evil and discovers unexpected camaraderie with her unusual companions. Beautifully rendering a mythological backdrop with a Welsh sheen, Ms. Haydon proves herself to be a spellbinding storyteller with the rare ability to manage remarkable characters with both intimacy and power." --<i>Romantic Times</i><p> "<i>Rhapsody</i> is a very entertaining fantasy novel that is one of the better epic adventures of the year. . . a stirring epic fantasy that will receive numerous accolades from fans and critics." --<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><p> "With <i>Rhapsody</i>, Elizabeth Haydon makes a magnificent fantasy debut. Her voice is warm, often humorous, and sure, her world a richly realized place of myth and magic, and her characters complex and utterly compelling. I can hardly wait for the next book in the trilogy!" --Mary Jo Putney</p><p> "In <i>Rhapsody</i>, Elizabeth Haydon gives us strong, compelling characters in a world both mysterious and familiar. Drawn through wonders of the fantastic and of the human soul, we, the readers, are always moving forward, never sure of where the plot, with its surprising twists and turns, is taking us. But we are always interested in finding out." --J. Gregory Keyes</p><p> "A strong book . . . I wish you the best." --Mario Puzo</p><p> "A stunningly told tale by a new fantasy author who is sure to go far." --Anne McCaffrey</p><p> "<i>Rhapsody</i> is movingly-written, epic fantasy that works on many levels. I read this book with a growing sense of pleasure, impressed not only with the author's deft plotting but also with her use of language. Haydon is a <i>writer</i>." --Morgan Llywelyn</p><p> "A powerful novel. It is lucid, interesting, well paced, well organized, adventurous, magical, and with characters who are original yet consistent to themselves. There are sequences of considerable power . . . I see a larger story framework developing, as it were the foundation of a pyramid we have as yet glimpsed only in part. This author will surely go far. I am amazed by the growing number of strong new voices that are appearing these days in fantasy, hitherto mostly male. Elizabeth Haydon is sure to change that." --Piers Anthony</p><p> "<i>Rhapsody</i> provides readers with a different heroine and the kind of action and interplay that proves the art of story-telling is alive and well without recourse to huge and endless battles. <i>Rhapsody</i> is entertaining and often witty." --L. E. Modesitt, Jr.</p><p> "Prepare to lose a weekend. Elizabeth Haydon's <i>Rhapsody</i> is filled with wit, adventure, and delightful characters. Pick up this book at your own risk--of neglecting your family, friends, and chores--while under the enchanted spell of <i>Rhapsody</i>." --Kathi Kamen Goldmark</p></p><h2>White Doves At Morning</h2><p>A very interesting, well written novel about the Civil War, set in Louisiana bayou country, the New Iberia and New Orleans areas in the 1800&#39;s.</p><p><b>James Lee Burke</b>, a rare winner of two Edgar Awards, and named Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America,&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;thirty-one previous novels and&nbsp;two collections of short stories, including such <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers as&nbsp;<i>The Glass Rainbow</i>,&nbsp;<i>Swan Peak</i>, <i>The Tin Roof Blowdown</i>, <i>Last Car to Elysian Fields,</i> and <i>Rain Gods</i>.&nbsp;He lives in Missoula, Montana.<br><br><b>Will Patton</b>'s numerous film credits include<i> Remember the Titans</i>, <i>The Punisher</i>, <i>The Mothman Prophesies</i>, <i>Armageddon</i>, and <i>The Spitfire Grill</i>.

Ten minutes later, deep inside the gum and persimmon and oak trees, her clothes strung with air vines that were silver with frost, the frozen leaves cracking under her feet, she heard the barking of the dogs and the yelps of their handlers who had just released them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She splashed into a slough, one that bled out of the woods into the dark swirl of the river where it made a bend through the plantation. The ice sawed at her ankles; the cold was like a hammer on her shins. But nonetheless she worked her way upstream, between cypress roots that made her think of a man's knuckles protruding from the shallows. Across the river the sun was a vaporous smudge above the bluffs, and she realized night would soon come upon her and that a level of coldness she had never thought possible would invade her bones and womb and teats and perhaps turn them to stone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She clutched the bottom of her stomach with both hands, as though holding a watermelon under her dress, and slogged up the embankment and collapsed under a lean-to where, in the summer months, an overseer napped in the afternoon while his charges bladed down the cypress trees for the soft wood Marse Jamison used to make cabinets in the big house on a bluff overlooking the river.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Even if she had known the river was called the Mississippi, the name would have held no significance for her. But the water boundary called the Ohio was another matter. It was somewhere to the north, somehow associated in her mind with the Jordan, and a black person only needed to wade across it to be as free as the children of Israel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Except no black person on the plantation could tell her exactly how far to the north this river was, and she had learned long ago never to ask a white person where the river called Ohio was located.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The light in the west died and through the breaks in the lean-to she saw the moon rising and the ground fog disappearing in the cold, exposing the hardness of the earth, the glazed and speckled symmetry of the tree trunks. Then a pain like an ax blade seemed to split her in half and she put a stick in her mouth to keep from crying out. As the time between the contractions shrank and she felt blood issue from her womb between her fingers, she was convinced the juju woman had been right, that this baby, her first, was a man-child, a warrior and a king.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She stared upward at the constellations bursting in the sky, and when she shut her eyes she saw her child inside the redness behind her eyelids, a powerful little brown boy with liquid eyes and a mouth that would seek both milk and power from his mother's breast.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She caught the baby in her palms and sawed the cord in half with a stone and tied it in a knot, then pressed the closed eyes and hungry mouth to her teat, just before passing out.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The dawn broke hard and cold, a yellow light that burst inside the woods and exposed her hiding place and brought no warmth or release from the misery in her bones. There was a dirty stench in the air, like smoke from a drowned campfire. She heard the dogs again, and when she rose to her feet the pain inside her told her she would never outrun them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn from critters, her mother had always said. They know God's way. Don't never ax Master or his family or the mens he hire to tell you the troot. Whatever they teach us is wrong, girl. Never forget that lesson, her mother had said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The doe always leads the hunter away from the fawn, Sarie thought. That's what God taught the doe, her mother had said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She wrapped the baby in the blanket that had been her only protection from the cold, then rose to her feet and covered the opening to the lean-to with a broken pine bough and walked slowly through the woods to the slough. She stepped into the water, felt it rush inside her shoes and over her ankles, then worked her way downstream toward the river. In the distance she heard axes knocking into wood and smelled smoke from a stump fire, and the fact that the work of the plantation went on rhythmically, not missing a beat, in spite of her child's birth and possible death reminded her once again of her own insignificance and the words Master had used to her yesterday afternoon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"You should have taken care of yourself, Sarie," he had said, his pantaloons tucked inside his riding boots, his youthful face undisturbed and serene and without blemish except for the tiny lump of tobacco in his jaw. "I'll see to it the baby doesn't lack for raiment or provender, but I'll have to send you to the auction house. You're not an ordinary nigger, Sarie. You won't be anything but trouble. I'm sorry it worked out this way."</p><p></p><p></p><p>When she came out of the water and labored toward the edge of the woods, she glanced behind her and in the thin patina of snow frozen on the ground she saw her own blood spore and knew it was almost her time, the last day in a lifetime of days that had been marked by neither hope nor despair but only unanswered questions: Where was the green place they had all come from? What group of men had made them chattel to be treated as though they had no souls, whipped, worked from cain't-see to cain't-see, sometimes branded and hamstrung?</p><p></p><p></p><p>The barking of the dogs was louder now but she no longer cared about either the dogs or the men who rode behind them. Her spore ended at the slough; her story would end here, too. The child was another matter. She touched the juju bag tied around her neck and prayed she and the child would be together by nightfall, in the warm, green place where lions lay on the beaches by a great sea.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But now she was too tired to think about any of it. She stood on the edge of the trees, the sunlight breaking on her face, then sat down heavily in the grass, the tops of her shoes dark with her blood. Through a red haze she saw a man in a stovepipe hat and dirty white breeches ride over a hillock behind his dogs, two other mounted men behind him, their horses steaming in the sunshine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The dogs surrounded her, circling, snuffing in the grass, their bodies bumping against one another, but they made no move against her person. The man in the stovepipe hat reined his horse and got down and looked with exasperation at his two companions. "Get these dogs out of here. If I hear that barking anymore, I'll need a new pair of ears," he said. Then he looked down at Sarie, almost respectfully. "You gave us quite a run."</p><p></p><p></p><p>She did not reply. His name was Rufus Atkins, a slight, hard-bodied man whose skin, even in winter, had the color and texture of a blacksmith's leather apron. His hair was a blackish-tan, long, combed straight back, and there were hollows in his cheeks that gave his face a certain fragility. But the cartilage around the jawbones was unnaturally dark, as though rubbed with blackened brick dust, knotted with a tension his manner hid from others.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rufus Atkins' eyes were flat, hazel, and rarely did they contain or reveal any definable emotion, as though he lived behind glass and the external world never registered in a personal way on his senses.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A second man dismounted, this one blond, his nose wind-burned, wearing a leather cap and canvas coat and a red-and-white-checkered scarf tied around his throat. On his hip he carried a small flintlock pistol that had three hand-smoothed indentations notched in the wood grips. In his right hand he gripped a horse quirt that was weighted with a lead ball sewn inside the bottom of the deerhide handle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"She done dropped it, huh?" he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"That's keenly observant of you, Clay, seeing as how the woman's belly is flat as a busted pig's bladder," Rufus Atkins replied.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Marse Jamison says find both of them, he means find both of them, Rufus," the man named Clay said, looking back into the trees at the blood spots in the snow.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rufus Atkins squatted down and ignored his companion's observation, his eyes wandering over Sarie's face.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"They say you filed your teeth into points 'cause there's an African king back there...</p></p><h2>Color Me Happy: 100 Coloring Templates That Will Make You Smile (Volume 2) (A Zen Coloring Book, 2)</h2><p><p>With each development in technology, our lives become more complicated.

The number one <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Patricia Cornwell calls her "outrageous and unrivaled." Nearly every reader and reviewer who has gotten a good taste of her exceptional Florida noir agrees: No one captures the steamy, vibrant, and lethal intensity of Miami better than the unsurpassed Edna. And no fictional investigator has more life, depth, character, and savvy than her peerless creation, crime reporter Britt Montero.</p><p>The perfect, nude corpse of a beautiful woman washes up on a pristine Miami Beach -- her body tanned and shapely, her nails elegantly manicured. The problem is that the victim, Kaithlin Jordan, was murdered ten years ago. And her convicted killer -- her husband, R. J. Jordan, scion of a wealthy and powerful South Florida family -- sits on death row, just weeks away from his execution.</p><p>Newspaper reporter Britt Montero recalls the high-profile murder trial that heated up a volatile tropical city like the merciless August sun. Even without a body, the prosecution's case against Jordan seemed airtight and the jury enthusiastically bought into it. Now R.J. is preparing to walk -- benefiting from the murderous "largess" of whoever drowned his wife in the ocean off Miami Beach -- and Britt's boundlessly curious nature is energized once more by a slew of questions that suddenly need answers. Did Kaithlin frame her husband for murder -- or did she simply efficiently flee an abusive marriage? And why, after successfully reinventing herself, had she returned to South Florida, only to meet a very bad end in deep turquoise water?</p><p>Impulsive and explosive, with a turbulent love life and a unique, highly charged relationship with this singular metropolis erected between swamp and sea, Britt is only truly happy when she's involved in a juicy murder story. And this one has the right smell and feel...and threat. Because somewhere in the tangle of an enigmatic beauty's bizarre life and even stranger rebirth -- somewhere between the sparkling gold coast glamour and flashing neon sleaze -- are secret passions and buried solutions that could doom an overly inquisitive journalist with a tendency to leap before she looks. After all, this is Miami, where anything is possible...even dying twice.</p></p><p>In her seventh outing for Miami crime reporter Britt Montero, Edna Buchanan (herself an erstwhile journalist for <i>The Miami Herald</i>) serves up a nice twist on a standard plot. The body of a beautiful naked woman floats in on the tide practically at Britt's feet, and it turns out to be that of a woman supposedly murdered a decade before by her wealthy husband. Most of the action focuses on freeing R.J. Jordan, the convicted killer, from his cell on death row. R.J., a handsome but decidedly unpleasant guy who maintained his innocence all along, isn't the slightest bit interested in apprehending his wife's killer. He's just happy her body turned up before he died for her murder. But Britt wants to know where Lily Jordan's been for the last 10 years, and why she came back to Miami just days before her husband was due to die. <p> To Britt's surprise, her own mother has an important clue, although it's all Britt can do to pry it out of her. Not only did the elegant, socially well- connected Montero matriarch know the victim, she even mentored Lily as she rose through the executive ranks of the Jordan family business. The new explications of the complicated relationship between Britt and her mother is a plus for fans of this bestselling series, who appreciate Buchanan's deft characterizations as well as her love for the city she has called home all her (and Britt's) life. As an extra fillip, there's Britt's growing relationship with the investigator who helped put R.J. away 10 years ago, a nice counterpoint to this ingenious updating of <i>Double Indemnity</i>. Buchanan's pacing is dead-on, as she stays one step ahead of even the most discerning reader right up to the explosive conclusion. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Trouble With Timothy (A Tale from the Care Bears)</h2><p>Friend Bear from the land of Care-a-lot shows Timothy that it is not necessary to misbehave in school in order to gain attention and be liked.</p><p></p><h2>A Treasury of Flower Fairies</h2><p>Sixty enchanting watercolor illustrations are reproduced, along with a collection of poems featuring the Flower Fairies.

Before he can show them to Nicholas Brisbane, the private inquiry agent he has retained for his protection, Sir Edward collapses and dies at his London home, in the presence of his wife, Julia, and a roomful of dinner guests.<br>Prepared to accept that Edward's death was due to a long-standing physical infirmity, Julia is outraged when Brisbane visits and suggests that Sir Edward has been murdered. It is a reaction she comes to regret when she discovers the damning paper for herself, and realizes the truth.<br>Determined to bring her husband's murderer to justice, Julia engages the enigmatic Brisbane to help her investigate Edward's demise. Dismissing his warnings that the investigation will be difficult, if not impossible, Julia presses forward, following a trail of clues that lead her to even more unpleasant truths, and ever closer to a killer who waits expectantly for her arrival.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Deanna Raybourn graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio with a double major in English and history and an emphasis on Shakespearean studies. She taught high school English for three years in San Antonio before leaving education to pursue a career as a novelist. Deanna makes her home in Virginia, where she lives with her husband and daughter and is hard at work on her next novel.<p>To say that I met Nicholas Brisbane over my husband's dead body is not entirely accurate. Edward, it should be noted, was still twitching upon the floor.</p> <p>I stared at him, not quite taking in the fact that he had just collapsed at my feet. He lay, curled like a question mark, his evening suit ink-black against the white marble of the floor. He was writhing, his fingers knotted.</p> <p>I leaned as close to him as my corset would permit. "Edward, we have guests. Do get up. If this is some sort of silly prank&#x2014;"</p> <p>"He is not jesting, my lady. He is convulsing."</p> <p>An impatient figure in black pushed past me to kneel at Edward's side. He busied himself for a few brisk moments, palpating and pulse-taking, while I bobbed a bit, trying to see over his shoulder. Behind me the guests were murmuring, buzzing, pushing closer to get a look of their own. There was a little thrill of excitement in the air. After all, it was not every evening that a baronet collapsed senseless in his own music room. And Edward was proving rather better entertainment than the soprano we had engaged.</p> <p>Through the press, Aquinas, our butler, managed to squeeze in next to my elbow.</p> <p>"My lady?"</p> <p>I looked at him, grateful to have an excuse to turn away from the spectacle on the floor.</p> <p>"Aquinas, Sir Edward has had an attack."</p> <p>"And would be better served in his own bed," said the gentleman from the floor. He rose, lifting Edward into his arms with a good deal of care and very little effort, it seemed. But Edward had grown thin in the past months. I doubted he weighed much more than I.</p> <p>"Follow me," I instructed, although Aquinas actually led the way out of the music room. People moved slowly out of our path, as though they regretted the little drama ending so quickly. There were some polite murmurs, some mournful clucking. I heard snatches as I passed through them.</p> <p>"The curse of the Greys, it is&#x2014;"</p> <p>"So young. But of course his father never saw thirty-five."</p> <p>"Never make old bones&#x2014;"</p> <p>"Feeble heart. Pity, he was always such a pleasant fellow."</p> <p>I moved faster, staring straight ahead so that I did not have to meet their eyes. I kept my gaze fixed on Aquinas' broad, black-wool back, but all the time I was conscious of those voices and the sound of footsteps behind me, the footsteps of the gentleman who was carrying my husband. Edward groaned softly as we reached the stairs and I turned. The gentleman's face was grim.</p> <p>"Aquinas, help the gentleman&#x2014;"</p> <p>"I have him," he interrupted, brushing past me. Aquinas obediently led him to Edward's bedchamber. Together they settled Edward onto the bed, and the gentleman began to loosen his clothes. He flicked a glance toward Aquinas. "Has he a doctor?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir. Doctor Griggs, Golden Square."</p> <p>"Send for him. Although I dare say it will be too late." Aquinas turned to me where I stood, hovering on the threshold. I never went into Edward's room. I did not like to do so now. It felt like an intrusion, a trespass on his privacy.</p> <p>"Shall I send for Lord March as well, my lady?"</p> <p>I blinked at Aquinas. "Why should Father come? He is no doctor."</p> <p>But Aquinas was quicker than I. I had thought the gentleman meant that Edward would have recovered from his attack by the time Doctor Griggs arrived. Aquinas, who had seen more of the world than I, knew better. </p> <p>He looked at me, his eyes carefully correct, and then I understood why he wanted to send for Father. As head of the family he would have certain responsibilities. </p> <p>I nodded slowly. "Yes, send for him." I moved into the room on reluctant legs. I knew I should be there, doing whatever little bit that I could for Edward. But I stopped at the side of the bed. I did not touch him.</p> <p>"And Lord Belmont?" Aquinas queried.</p> <p>I thought for a moment. "No, it is Friday. Parliament is sitting late."</p> <p>That much was a mercy. Father I could cope with. But not my eldest brother as well. "And I suppose you ought to call for the carriages. Send everyone home. Make my apologies."</p> <p>He left us alone then, the stranger and I. We stood on opposite sides of the bed, Edward convulsing between us. He stopped after a moment and the gentleman placed a finger at his throat.</p> <p>"His pulse is very weak," he said finally. "You should prepare yourself."</p> <p>I did not look at him. I kept my eyes fixed on Edward's pale face.</p> <p>It shone with sweat, its surface etched with lines of pain. This was not how I wanted to remember him. </p> <p>"I have known him for more than twenty years," I said finally, my voice tight and strange. "We were children together. We used to play pirates and knights of the Round Table. Even then, I knew his heart was not sound. He used to go quite blue sometimes when he was overtired. This is not unexpected."</p> <p>I looked up then to find the stranger's eyes on me. They were the darkest eyes I had ever seen, witch-black and watchful. His gaze was not friendly. He was regarding me coldly, as a merchant will appraise a piece of goods to determine its worth. I dropped my eyes at once.</p> <p>"Thank you for your concern for my husband's health, sir. You have been most helpful. Are you a friend of Edward's?"</p> <p>He did not reply at once. Edward made a noise in the back of his throat and the stranger moved swiftly, rolling him onto his side and thrusting a basin beneath his mouth. Edward retched, horribly, groaning. When he finished, the gentleman put the basin to the side and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief. Edward gave a little whimper and began to shiver. The gentleman watched him closely. </p> <p>"Not a friend, no. A business associate," he said finally. "My name is Nicholas Brisbane."</p> <p>"I am&#x2014;"</p> <p>"I know who you are, my lady."</p> <p>Startled at his rudeness, I looked up, only to find those eyes again, fixed on me with naked hostility. I opened my mouth to reproach him, but Aquinas appeared then. I turned to him, relieved.</p> <p>"Aquinas?"</p> <p>"The carriages are being brought round now, my lady. I have sent Henry for Doctor Griggs and Desmond for his lordship. Lady Otterbourne and Mr. Phillips both asked me to convey their concern and their willingness to help should you have need of them." "Lady Otterbourne is a meddlesome old gossip and Mr. Phillips would be no use whatsoever. Send them home."</p> <p>I was conscious of Mr. Brisbane behind me, listening to every word. I did not care. For some unaccountable reason, the man thought ill of me already. I did not mind if he thought worse. </p> <p>Aquinas left again, but I did not resume my post by the bed. I took a chair next to the door and remained there, saying nothing and wondering what was going to happen to all of the food. We had ordered far too much in any event. Edward never liked to run short. I could always tell Cook to serve it in the servants' hall, but after a few days even the staff would tire of it. Before I could decide what to do with the lobster patties and salad molds, Aquinas entered again, leading Doctor Griggs. The elderly man was perspiring freely, patting his ruddy face with a handkerchief and gasping. He had taken the stairs too quickly. I rose and he took my hand.</p> <p>"I was afraid of this," he murmured. "The curse of the Greys, it is. All snatched before their time. My poor girl." I smiled feebly at him. Doctor Griggs had attended my mother at my birth, as well as her nine other confinements. We had known each other too long to stand on ceremony. He patted my hand and moved to the bed. He felt for Edward's pulse, shaking his head as he did so. Edward vomited again, and Doctor Griggs watched him carefully, examining the contents of the basin. I turned away.</p> <p>I tried not to hear the sounds coming from the bed, the groans and the rattling breaths. I would have stopped my ears with my hands, but I knew it would look childish and cowardly. Griggs continued his examination, but before he finished Aquinas stepped into the room.</p> <p>"Lord March, my lady." He moved aside and Father entered.</p> <p>"Julia," he said, opening his arms. I went into them, burying my face against his waistcoat. He smelled of tobacco and book leather. He kept one arm tucked firmly around me as he looked over my head. "Griggs, you damned fool. Julia should have been sent away." The doctor made some reply, but I did not hear it. My father was pushing me gently out the door. I tried to look past him, to see what they were doing to Edward, but Father moved his body and prevented me. He gave me a sad, gentle smile. Anyone else might have mistaken that smile, but I did not. I knew he expected obedience. I nodded.</p> <p>"I shall wait in my room."</p> <p>"That would be best. I will come when there is something to tell." My maid, Morag, was waiting for me. She helped me out of my silk gown and into something more suitable. She offered me warm milk or brandy, but I knew I would never be able to hold anything down. I only wanted to sit, watching the clock on the mantel as it ticked away the minutes left.</p> <p>Morag continued to fuss, poking at the fire and muttering complaints about the work to come. She was right about that. There would be much work for her when I put on widow's weeds. It was unlucky to keep crepe in the house, I reminded myself. It would have to be sent for after Edward passed. I thought about such things&#x2014;crepe for the mirrors, black plumes for the horses&#x2014;because then I did not have to think about what was happening in Edward's room. It was rather like waiting for a birth, these long, tense minutes of sitting, straining one's ears on tiptoe for the slightest sound. I expected to hear something, but the walls were thick and I heard nothing. Even when the clock struck midnight, the little voice on my mantel chiming twelve times, I could not hear the tall case clock in the hall. I started to mention the peculiarity of it to Morag, because one could always hear the case clock from any room in the house, when I realized what it meant.</p> <p>"Morag, the clocks have stopped."</p> <p>She looked at me, her lips parted to speak, but she said nothing. Instead she bowed her head and began to pray. A moment later, the door opened. It was Father. He said nothing. I went to him and his hand cradled my head like a benediction. He held me for a very long time, as he had not done since I was a child. </p> <p>"It is all right, my dear," he said finally, sounding older and more tired than I had ever heard him. "It is over."</p> <p>But of course, he was entirely wrong. It was only the beginning.</p></p><h2>The New Journalism</h2><p>Comments on the evolution of the New Journalism and presents representative writings by Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, and others</p><p></p><h2>Creating a Business Plan (Pocket Mentor)</h2><p>Every business needs a business plan--a plan to meet the expected and unexpected opportunities and obstacles the future holds.

Long ago, all the human kingdoms were ruled by powerful sorcerers. Then a plague came and the sorcerers died.&nbsp; Nobody misses them.

In coming to the country of the Liglim, she, Derian Carter, and Blind Seer discovered that magic is still working in the world, and that it isn&#x2019;t always the evil they&#x2019;d been warned against. But it also turned out that the old plague specifically targeted magic users.&nbsp; And when Firekeeper and her friends learned to open the gates between worlds, the plague came back with them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Firekeeper, Blind Seer, and Derian Carter survived the plague: not unchanged, but still themselves.

What happens next will be the culmination of the remarkable fantasy epic that began with <i>Through Wolf&#x2019;s Eyes.</i></p><p>Jane Lindskold lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.&nbsp; She is the author of <i>Through Wolf's Eyes; Wolf's Head, Wolf's Heart; The Dragon of Despair; Wolf Captured; Wolf Hunting; The Buried Pyramid; Child of a Rainless Year;</i> and several prior fantasy novels, including <i>Changer</i>, <i>Legends Walking, </i>and <i>Brother to Dragons, Companion to Owls.</i> With Roger Zelazny, she wrote <i>Lord Demon</i> and <i>Donnerjack.</i>Wolf's Blood<br><i>BOOK I</i>IFIREKEEPER STOOD, feet planted slightly apart, head held high, and looked from her past into her future.She was a woman of indeterminate age, certainly no longer a child, but beyond that certain estimation placing her age would have been a challenge. Life lived in all the tempers changing seasons could hold had browned fair skin and faded brown hair, but her eyes were bright, her teeth white and strong.Her attire showed hard use. She was clad in worn leather trousers laced below the knee, and a battered cotton shirt that might once have been dyed pale green. Her feet were bare. A long hunting knife from whose hilt a garnet shone a muted dark red was belted at her waist. A bow was slung over her shoulder, along with a quiver containing a handful of arrows.Dozens of scars, silvery white against the tanned skin, again testified to a hard life, yet there was a quickness to Firekeeper's motions, a fluidity and power that spoke of youth and youth's vigor. This contrasted vividly with something in her dark, dark eyes, something that hinted at challenges and sorrows young bones and muscles should not have known, but that had scarred as deeply as any tooth or claw."Blind Seer, how many years have gone by since you and I crossed the Iron Mountains into the east?"Firekeeper spoke a language most humans would not have even realized was being spoken, much less understood, and the one to whom she spoke was no human but rather a grey wolf the size of a small pony, albeit much leaner in build. Blind Seer did not look at Firekeeper when she spoke, his piercingly blue eyes focused, as were her own, on some middle distance."Six springs into spring again," came the wolf 's reply. "Six rounding of does' sides and budding of new antlers on proud bucks, six springs where fat puppies stumbled from the dens in which their mothers had hidden them to face the proudinspection of their packs. Six, if you count this spring, and this I do most sincerely."Firekeeper huffed agreement through her nose, a movement of air that spoke volumes to the wolf."Is it spring, then, that makes me restless?""Don't blame spring, sweet Firekeeper. Spring has done nothing but be spring. You know who is to blame, who has been whispering in your ear. I have heard what you say in your dreams, and although you have not told me, I know who has returned to haunt you.""I have always had nightmares," Firekeeper replied, not quite admitting to the truth of the wolf 's statement."Always," Blind Seer agreed. "As long as I have known you, as long as any of my pack have known you--and we took you in and made you our own when you were but a small child--as long ago as that and maybe before, you have had nightmares, but this is something different, and you know it and I know it. Will you deny what is as plain as sunlight on a cloudless day?"Firekeeper sighed and buried her hand in the thick fur of Blind Seer's scruff. "I cannot, nor will I, at least not to you. Three nights running and three more before that, the Meddler has come into my dreams. He talks most seriously, and the matters he raises are grave and seem to make sense, but I fear to be guided by him."Blind Seer's hackles rose. Firekeeper felt the stiff guard hairs of his coat prickle against her skin."The Meddler earned that name for a reason, dear heart," the wolf said in a rumbling growl. "He also earned the ill reputation that goes with that name, as we know all too well. His meddling has caused considerable trouble, not just for us, although we have seen our share, but--if we are to believe the tales Harjeedian tells--for generations so long past that even their bones have returned to the soil."Firekeeper nodded agreement that held the faintest trace of reluctance. The wolf tilted back his head to gaze upon her face."Will you tell me what the Meddler has said when he comes into your dreams?"Firekeeper hesitated, knowing her delay was a trifle longer than would be polite. Had she been speaking with a human, her delay might have been taken as weighing the wisdom of speaking seriously about dreams. However, the wolf--who knew her mood from her scent--was not to be so easily fooled. She felt her skin heat with a blush.In response to that blush, Firekeeper was aware of the rumble of Blind Seer's growl, inaudible to her ears but felt through her fingertips. Blind Seer had heard the sweet edge of the Meddler's tongue, and he knew the Meddler had an intense interest in Firekeeper. This interest might have flattered Blind Seer, for wolves are not immune to more highly prizing that which another desires, but the bond between Firekeeper and Blind Seer was sufficiently unique that the wolf was threatened rather than flattered.But while Firekeeper did not precisely return the Meddler's interest, still she experienced her own peculiar fascination with him. The fascination was not--or so she told herself--that which a female feels for a mate. How could it be? The Meddler was noteven alive. His body had been slain centuries before Firekeeper had been born, but his spirit, entrapped in a prison constructed for that purpose, had persisted.Firekeeper told herself that she was interested in the Meddler because he possessed knowledge that no one else did. But Blind Seer read her scent--so much more honest than her thoughts--and was threatened by a potential rival."I will tell you," Firekeeper said at last, "but dreams are strange, and sometimes I have trouble recalling their logic.""Some trouble," Blind Seer agreed, "but not too much trouble, else you would not be so restless. Tell what you can. I will listen."Firekeeper sat next to the wolf, flinging her arm over his shoulders. He, in turn, settled onto his haunches. Blind Seer was large enough that in this attitude Firekeeper's head now leaned against his own. She sat this way for several long breaths, taking comfort from their proximity."The Meddler says," she began, the words tumbling out like water spilling over a beaver's dam, "at great length, supporting his case with many cogent arguments, that I must seek the source of the Fire Plague.""The source of the Fire Plague?" Blind Seer asked. "What purpose would be served in finding the source of the Fire Plague?""Not just the source," Firekeeper amended. "The source and, with the source, the cure.""Why does the Meddler care?" Blind Seer said. "If anyone is immune to the Fire Plague, it is he. Nor did he take particular care to warn us of the Fire Plague when we crossed to where we would be vulnerable to it. Why should he care now?""I asked the Meddler why he didn't warn us," Firekeeper said, glad to prove that she did not listen to the Meddler with unquestioning obedience. "He claims that he did not know the Fire Plague still lived in the Old World. He says that such things fade and die. Over a hundred years have passed since the Fire Plague first appeared--and he was already entrapped then, and so only knew of it in the abstract. The Meddler claims he did not know for certain where the Setting Sun gateway would take us. Nor did he worry unduly that it might take us to the Old World. He thought the Fire Plague likely dead or aged beyond ability to harm us. Remember, he knew nothing of how the Old World had fared since his imprisonment. He had difficulty enough contacting the New.""Perhaps this is true," Blind Seer admitted grudgingly. "After all, even for one such as him, knowing what is happening across a great ocean might be difficult.""The Meddler says that such knowing is perhaps not quite impossible," Firekeeper said, "but close enough to impossible.""I am pleased that the Meddler does not claim his knowing what happens far away is impossible," Blind Seer said, "for I have seen him at home in places I would have termed impossible if I had not been there myself. I would trust him less than I do were he to claim something impossible.""And you do not trust him very much," Firekeeper said."Less even than that," Blind Seer replied. "Has the Meddler told you why it is so important that the source of the Fire Plague be found--beyond, of course, that this is the way to find a cure. Why is a cure necessary all of a sudden?""Did you enjoy your experience when you were seized with the Plague?"The blue-eyed wolf stiffened, even seemed to stop breathing. What had happened to him when the Fire Plague had seized hold of him and nearly killed him was a matter Blind Seer steadfastly refused to discuss. Like Firekeeper's perverse interest in the Meddler, it was one of several things that had driven a wedge between the pair, although to any watching them woman and wolf would seem as close as ever."The Fire Plague is not something to enjoy," Blind Seer finally replied, "only to survive.""I would go a bit further," Firekeeper said, "and say the Fire Plague is something I would wish upon no one--not even an enemy. How then can we wish it upon our friends?""I do not.""The Meddler says that if a cure is not found, then we are as good as wishing the Fire Plague upon our friends. Thus far we have been fortunate. The Plague has not reappeared in the New World, but we know now that those who were born in the New World are not immune. How long will our luck hold? How long before the Fire Plague crosses as we have crossed?""We have taken care," Blind Seer protested, "that none actively ill return from the Old World to the New until the sickness has run its course.""Someday we will judge wrong," Firekeeper said. "Even if we do not, what of those who wish to come from the New World to the Nexus Islands? You know as well as I do that our allies have held those islands thus far only through constant vigilance. How long before weariness or boredom or even betrayal leads to a disaster? We cannot recruit further support from the Old World. If we are to hold the Nexus Islands, we must bring reinforcements from the New World.""We can bring those who lack the magical talents upon which the Fire Plague feeds."Firekeeper pulled back so she could look Blind Seer in the face--the locking of her gaze with his own a gesture of challenge among wolves as it was not among humans."And can we be sure to know in advance who possesses magical talents and who does not? It seems to me that there are those in whom the talents are so deeply buried that even they do not know the talents are there."Blind Seer glowered at her, blue eyes narrowing to slits, ears pinning back, and fangs revealed in a snarl. He held that threat for a moment, but Firekeeper did not break his gaze. After a long moment the wolf shook himself calm."True. Such does happen. What if we recruit one or more of the maimalodalum to help inspect our candidates in advance? The maimalodalum have the ability to sense magic--even magic that is very faint. They could review potential candidates, and turn away those who would be endangered.""There are few maimalodalum," Firekeeper said, "and those few are isolated on Misheemnekuru, and do not wish their presence to be known to the world. It is possible we might recruit one or even two, but this would only be a stopgap. In the end, we would still need a cure--or expose our allies to the Fire Plague.""And the Meddler assures you that to find a cure, you must find the source of the Fire Plague. How does he know that? It seems to me that when the Meddler wishes to do so, he knows a great deal--and when it is convenient, he claims ignorance. Which do we believe, his ignorance or his wisdom?""I believe neither," Firekeeper said, "but I can see the sense in what he says. Surely nothing comes from nothing. If you want to stop a stream you must block its source. If the does are killed there will be no more fawns. So it will be with the Fire Plague ... I hope.""So he has convinced you to go hunting for the source of the Fire Plague?""He is trying to do so.""A hunt that would take you into the Old World.""I think so.""Where you speak none of the languages."Firekeeper raised her chin in defiance."Where there are no Royal Beasts to help you."Firekeeper held her silence."Where, if we are to believe those we met on the Nexus Islands, there are places where magic is--if possible--hated even more fiercely than it is in our homeland. And you will go there, searching for a cure to the very disease or curse or whatever it is that broke the power of magic, that broke the power that was used to dominate and destroy humans and Beasts alike in the Old World and the New."Firekeeper inclined her head in the smallest of nods."Yes. That is what I am considering doing. Will you come with me?"Blind Seer huffed his breath out in a long sigh. "Of course. Where else would I be but at your side?"&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>DERIAN CARTER COULDN'TMAKE HIMSELF GO HOME. Sitting in the front room of the stable master's house--what had become his house on the Nexus Islands--he tried to explain how he felt to the young woman seated across the room from him."Isende, look at me," Derian said, a pleading note in his voice. "Look at what the Plague--what querinalo--has done to me.""I am looking at you," she replied. Isende tucked a lock of hair behind one ear as ifto emphasize that nothing was blocking her vision. "I see a tall young man with broad shoulders, red hair, and very nice eyes.""Red hair that grows like a mane," Derian said, reaching up and tugging. "By all my ancestors, I have a forelock! My ears are pointed and hairy and I can wriggle them. My eyes--those 'nice eyes' used to be hazel. Now they're brown--and the irises are weird. They blot out more of the whites. My finger and toenails are hard now. I need a farrier's kit to clip them.""And you can eat grass," Isende said, "and talk to horses. Derian, the moon has shown all aspects of her face five or six times since you had querinalo. I thought you were adjusting to what happened to you. You went to see your friend when she had her baby. When are you going to visit your family? I know you miss them. I've seen the fat letters that go out with just about every post. Spring is going to open up the ports to shipping. With the gate, you're less than a moonspan from the harbor at u-Bishinti. If you left now, you could be home to Hawk Haven by midsummer at the latest. If you delay too long, winter will close the ports again.""You have no idea how my people feel about magic," Derian replied. "I mean, your people dislike how magic was used and abused by the Old Country rulers, but you don't hate magic for itself. Magic is one of your deities. You see her face when you look up at the moon. It's not that way at home. Having a talent wasn't too bad, especially since my talent was one of those that could pretty much be concealed. After all, I am a livery stable owner's son. When I think about it, I'm not even sure I knew I had a talent until people started pointing out the obvious to me.""I grew up," Isende said, her tones dreamy, "with people thinking I was a freak. Looking a bit different didn't matter much in Gak, because so many different peoples fled there during the chaos, and after a few generations there were some odd combinations. So having this weird hair that is brown underneath and sort of golden on top wasn't...</p><h2>Complete Guide to Needlework</h2><p>Published In 1983 : Reprinted Edition With Amendments : Reader's Digest Books : Large Landscape Format &amp; Very Heavy At Just Under 2 Kilos : No D / J : Glazed Photographic Boards : Overall , A Very Nice Book :</p><p>More than twenty-six hundred drawings and photographs and clearly presented directions provide an understanding of the techniques involved in numerous traditional needlework crafts, including embroidery, quilting, applique, macrame, knitting, and rug hooking.</p><h2>Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon</h2><p>Forty years ago, Buzz Aldrin became the second human, minutes after Neil Armstrong, to set foot on a celestial body other than the Earth. The event remains one of mankind&#x2019;s greatest achievements and was witnessed by the largest worldwide television audience in history. In the years since, millions more have had their Earth-centric perspective unalterably changed by the iconic photograph of Aldrin standing on the surface of the moon, the blackness of space behind him and his fellow explorer and the Eagle reflected in his visor. Describing the alien world he was walking upon, he uttered the words &#x201c;magnificent desolation.&#x201d; And as the astronauts later sat in the Eagle, waiting to begin their journey back home, knowing that they were doomed unless every system and part on board worked flawlessly, it was Aldrin who responded to Mission Control&#x2019;s clearance to take off with the quip, &#x201c;Roger. Understand. We&#x2019;re number one on the runway.&#x201d;<br><br>The flight of Apollo 11 made Aldrin one of the most famous persons on our planet, yet few people know the rest of this true American hero&#x2019;s story. In <i>Magnificent Desolation</i>, Aldrin not only gives us a harrowing first-person account of the lunar landing that came within seconds of failure and the ultimate insider&#x2019;s view of life as one of the superstars of America&#x2019;s space program, he also opens up with remarkable candor about his more personal trials&#x2013;and eventual triumphs&#x2013;back on Earth. From the glory of being part of the mission that fulfilled President Kennedy&#x2019;s challenge to reach the moon before the decade was out, Aldrin returned home to an Air Force career stripped of purpose or direction, other than as a public relations tool that NASA put to relentless use in a seemingly nonstop world tour. The twin demons of depression and alcoholism emerged&#x2013;the first of which Aldrin confronted early and publicly, and the second of which he met with denial until it nearly killed him. He burned through two marriages, his Air Force career came to an inglorious end, and he found himself selling cars for a living when he wasn&#x2019;t drunkenly wrecking them. Redemption came when he finally embraced sobriety, gained the love of a woman, Lois, who would become the great joy of his life, and dedicated himself to being a tireless advocate for the future of space exploration&#x2013;not only as a scientific endeavor but also as a thriving commercial enterprise.<br><br>These days Buzz Aldrin is enjoying life with an enthusiasm that reminds us how far it is possible for a person to travel, literally and figuratively. As an adventure story, a searing memoir of self-destruction and self-renewal, and as a visionary rallying cry to once again set our course for Mars and beyond, <i>Magnificent Desolation</i> is the thoroughly human story of a genuine hero.</p><p>On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts BUZZ ALDRIN and Neil Armstrong landed their lunar module on the Sea of Tranquillity and became the first humans to walk on the moon. Aldrin has since been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and more than fifty other awards and medals from the United States and other countries. He holds a doctorate in astronautics from MIT. Since retiring from the U.S. Air Force and NASA, Dr. Aldrin has remained at the forefront of efforts to ensure a continued leading role for America in manned space exploration. He founded a rocket design company, Starcraft Boosters, Inc., and the ShareSpace Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to opening the doors to space tourism for all people. Buzz and his wife, Lois, live in Los Angeles. <br><br>KEN ABRAHAM is a New York Times bestselling author, known around the world for his collaborations with celebrities and high-profile public figures.1 A JOURNEY for ALL MANKIND Wednesday, July 16, 1969, 6:00 a.m. (EDT) Countdown: T minus three hours, thirty minutes to liftoff. Clear Florida sky.<br><br>Elevated 300 feet in the air on an upper platform of Kennedy Space Center&#x2019;s Launch Pad 39-A, I stood alone on the grating of the towering gantry. A few yards away, loaded with more than 2,000 tons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen propellant, the giant Saturn V rocket also stood, primed for liftoff as the countdown progressed. Large shards of frost were already falling off its outer skin from the super-chilled liquid oxygen within.<br><br>Hours earlier my Apollo 11 crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, and I had enjoyed a predawn steak-and-eggs breakfast&#x2014;an astronaut tradition&#x2014;and had gone through an elaborate suiting-up with NASA&#x2019;s equipment team helping us get into our pressurized suits, helmets, gloves, and boots. Along with our Pad Leader, G�nter Wendt, a gray-haired man of German descent who had worked on almost every launch since the early days of the Mercury program, the three of us, carrying our portable air-conditioning ventilators as though we were heading off to work with our briefcases, loaded into the courier van for the short drive out to the launchpad.<br><br>Slowly we ascended in the gantry elevator, passing red metal grated walkways at various intervals leading to strategic areas of the rocket. Each of us had trained for his entire life leading up to this moment. As a crew, we had worked together for nearly a year, with Neil and I initially on the backup crew for the gutsy Apollo 8 mission, the first to fly around the moon after only one prior mission with the Saturn V, and then with Mike as the prime crew for the Apollo 11 mission. Because of the seating order in the cramped conditions of the Apollo command module&#x2014;comparable to the interior of a small van in which the three of us would live and work for more than a week&#x2014;climbing over one another to enter the craft while wearing our spacesuits was next to impossible. So G�nter stopped the elevator about three-fourths of the way up, and dropped me off to wait there on the metal grat- ing while he, Neil, and Mike proceeded two more flights up to where the elevator opened at the &#x201c;white room,&#x201d; the final preparation area leading to the narrow hatch opening to the spacecraft. In less than three and half hours, if all went well, the enormous rocket, with the power of an atomic bomb, would release an engulfing fireball and lumber off the pad, slowly gathering speed as it rose majestically into the sky, launching America&#x2019;s first attempt to land human beings on the moon.<br><br>The sun had not yet come up and was barely peeking above the horizon as I stood on the grating and peered through the clear bubble helmet I wore. The only sound I could hear came from my ventilation unit. Looking up and down the coastline, my eyes scanned the beaches for miles along the causeway near Cape Canaveral, where more than a million people had started gathering the night before, trekking in cars, motorcycles, pickup trucks, campers, and large motor homes, inching their way through bumper-to-bumper traffic as they sought the perfect launch viewing location. Already people were filling in every available spot of dry ground, and thousands of boats were anchored on the Indian and Banana rivers near the Cape. Without a good set of binoculars, most of the spectators could not see me, and from my vantage point I could barely see them, but I could see the evidence of them in the flickering campfires that dotted the beaches in the darkness. Everyone knew that something big was about to happen.<br><br>Because of the danger of explosion should something go wrong, the area immediately near the Saturn V was evacuated except for technicians making their final pre-launch checks. Even if the launch was perfect, no human could stay within several miles of it outside of the Firing Room, the launch control center at the Cape. The hot gases and thunderous noise would consume anyone standing too close to the rocket at ignition. The VIP spectator area, from which President Nixon, former president Lyndon B. Johnson, the astronauts&#x2019; families, politicians, celebrities, and others with the coveted special pass would watch the launch, was a full three miles away. Even there, the vibrations would be felt, and the roar from the engines would be almost deafening.<br><br>I looked to the south, where some of the older launch pads were located, and I couldn&#x2019;t help letting my eyes linger on Launch Pad 34, where, two and a half years earlier, three of my fellow astronauts&#x2014;Gus Grissom, Roger Chaffee, and Ed White&#x2014;had lost their lives when they were trapped inside their space capsule in a torrid burst of flames during a pre-launch training test for Apollo 1. Ed had been a year behind me at West Point, where we became friends, and we&#x2019;d later served together in the Air Force as fighter pilots in Germany, flying F-100s in the &#x201c;Big 22&#x201d; Squadron. He was the key person who had kindled and encouraged my efforts to contribute to the space program and ultimately become an astronaut, and now he was gone.<br><br>Instinctively my hand moved to a pocket on my spacesuit that contained a special pouch in which I carried an original mission patch honoring the men who had died aboard Apollo 1, as well as various medals honoring Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov, who had been killed on Soyuz 1, and Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. In that same pouch I carried a silicon disk inscribed with wishes from leaders of seventy-three nations of the world, and a gold pin in the shape of the olive branch of peace that we had chosen as a symbol of our mission for all mankind. I planned to leave these tributes on the moon.<br><br>Not too far from Pad 34, I could see the remnants of Pad 19, where Jim Lovell and I had crewed the last mission of the Gemini program, for a series of complex rendezvous maneuvers and the world&#x2019;s first successful spacewalk. It was exhilarating to end that program on a high note and pave the way for Apollo. I thought about how far we had come since man&#x2019;s dream of flight was first realized when the Wright Brothers&#x2019; Flyer took to the air on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, at Kill Devil Hill, near Kitty Hawk, in 1903&#x2014;the very year my mother, Marion Moon, was born. Now, only sixty-six years later, we were aiming for a much longer, more daring, and dangerous flight.<br><br>For fifteen minutes I stood on that walkway, suspended from the steadily marching countdown, and enjoying a moment of peace and solitude as I contemplated the journey ahead. I recalled just how wonderful my life had been to get me to this point. All the facets and experiences had worked out along the way to put me in the right place at the right time. Now I was leaving Earth to land on another celestial body, and, if all went as planned, I would return to family and friends, to a full life. Our confidence was high&#x2014;about 60 percent certain that we would succeed in landing on the moon, the part that had never been done before, and 90 percent that we would make it back home alive. We had trained, tested, and simulated nearly each element of the mission. But there were no guarantees. Even with all the preparation, a myriad of things could go wrong. As astronauts, we were trained to accept such risks, even the risk of not returning.<br><br>Finally, G�nter was ready for me. I ascended the remaining twenty feet or so, and G�nter helped me into the hatch, strapping me into my seat in the center couch, between Neil on my left, strategically situated near the abort handle, and Mike on my right. As we settled in, there was nothing left to do but wait while the countdown continued.<br><br>-., At 9:32 a.m., as the five large Saturn V engines ignited, we heard the final sequence of the countdown in our headsets: &#x201c;T minus ten, nine, eight . . .&#x201d; I quickly glanced at Neil and Mike, and we exchanged nervous but confident grins. Outside, at the base of the rocket, gases rushed out of each of the engine nozzles as we built up thrust. &#x201c;T minus five, four, three . . .&#x201d; With the engines running at full power, the gantry latches released and for a couple of seconds that seemed like forever, the rocket was standing unsupported, free as an eagle ready to soar.<br><br>&#x201c;Two, one . . . zero . . .&#x201d; The normally calm voice of Public Affairs Officer Jack King cracked with emotion from the Firing Room. &#x201c;All engines running!&#x201d; Even inside the command module with our helmets on, we could hear the mighty rumble. What looked like hundreds of tiny amber lights blinked on the instrument panels in front of us as the controlled but excited voice cried, &#x201c;Liftoff! We have a liftoff!&#x201d;<br><br>The rumbling sound grew louder and the huge rocket felt as though it swayed slightly as it smoothly inched off the pad. In fact it was so smooth that at first we couldn&#x2019;t detect the exact moment we left the ground. More large shards of frost fell from the sleek metal sides as blue sky seemed to move past the hatch window directly above me. Below us an inferno of flames, steam, and gases billowed all around the launch pad. With 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing all 3,240 tons of the rocket and spacecraft, we cleared the tower and rapidly accelerated, the g forces dramatically building up and pressing against us.

There is also a chronology, list of Selected Exhibitions, Selected References, contributors and Index. John Henry Twachtman (1853 - 1902) was an American painter best known for his impressionist landscapes, though his painting style varied widely through his career. Art historians consider Twachtman&#39;s style of American Impressionism to be among the more personal and experimental of his generation. He was a member of &#34;The Ten&#34;, a loosely allied group of American artists dissatisfied with professional art organizations, who banded together in 1898 to exhibit their works as a stylistically unified group.</p><p></p><h2>Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell</h2><p>Written with full access to all Powell&#39;s public and private papers, this biography details Powell&#39;s Midlands childhood, his appointment at the age of 25 as Professor of Greek at the University of Adelaide, his writing of poetry, his love for an Irish woman and his &#34;Rivers of Blood&#34; speech.</p><p>Simon Heffer was born in 1960 and educated at King Edward VI School, Chelmsford, and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he read English.

Reprint.</p><p><i>A Book of Memories</i> is a novel within a novel. The outer shell of Hungarian author Peter Nadas's ambitious tale concerns a nameless Hungarian writer and his m�nage � trois with an aging actress and a younger man in East Germany. While the contemporary writer's own story unfolds, he is busily at work on an historical novel about a German novelist named Thomas Thoenissen. As if a novel about a novelist writing about a novelist wasn't confusing enough, the two fictional writers have a great deal in common, including an unnatural affection for their mothers and a predilection for bisexual triangles. Throw into this already heady brew a great deal of Eastern European cold-war politics, and it becomes obvious that <i>A Book of Memories</i> requires a serious commitment from the reader. <p> Moving in time between the old Stalinist era and post-communist Eastern Europe, Peter Nadas convincingly conveys the effects of communism, both as it happened and as it collapsed. In his unnamed narrator he creates a perfect conduit between two times; the narrator grew up in a privileged communist family, the son of the state prosecutor in a Stalinist regime. In chronicling the boy's passage from child to man, Nadas paints a vivid portrait of the secrecy, fear, and tension in a society in which the personal and the political are often one and the same.</p><p></p><p><b></b></p><b>P�ter&nbsp;N�das</b> is&nbsp;the author of the novels&nbsp;<i>A Book of Memories</i>, <i>The End of a Family Story</i>, and <i>Love.&nbsp; </i>He lives in Gombosszeg, in western Hungary.</p><h2>Beatrice Ojakangas&#39; Great Holiday Baking Book</h2><p>No holiday would be complete without the wonderful baked goods that make every occasion special.

At fifteen he went to Canada and worked as a farm hand, a wool carder, and a bank clerk. In 1891 he returned to England and was introduced to the book arts by his brother Sydney, a British museum curator, collector, and well-connected figure in the literary world and the private secretary to William Morris. In 1893, Douglas was apprenticed to Thomas J. Cobden-Sanderson at the Doves Bindery. There he learned the importance of combining quality materials with technical skill and creativity. He founded his own bindery in London in 1897 and took up a teaching position at the London County Council Central School of Arts and Crafts. His works include: Bookbinding, and the Care of Books (1901), Some Notes on Bookbinding (1929) and Bookbinding as a School Subject (1939).</p><p>Douglas Cockerell was perhaps the premier bookbinder of the early twentieth century. Many of his pioneering techniques are still used today by hand bookbinders and curators of fine books. In this, his classic exposition of the bookbinder's art, he details the steps used in the hand-binding of books, various decorative techniques, and provides useful, practical information on the proper care of books. This charmingly written and supremely practical book gives a unique look at an increasingly rare art form by one of its greatest practitioners.

For more than fifty years Chimen and his wife, Miriam, hosted epic gatherings in their house of books that brought together many of the age&#x2019;s greatest thinkers.<br><br> The atheist son of one of the century&#x2019;s most important rabbis, Chimen was born in 1916 near Minsk, spent his early teenage years in Moscow while his father served time in a Siberian labor camp for religious proselytizing, and then immigrated to London, where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx and became involved in left-wing politics. He briefly attended the newly established Hebrew University in Jerusalem, until World War II interrupted his studies. Back in England, he married, and for many years he and Miriam ran a respected Jewish bookshop in London&#x2019;s East End. When the Nazis invaded Russia in June 1941, Chimen joined the Communist Party, becoming a leading figure in the party&#x2019;s National Jewish Committee. He remained a member until 1958, when, shockingly late in the day, he finally acknowledged the atrocities committed by Stalin. In middle age, Chimen reinvented himself once more, this time as a liberal thinker, humanist, professor, and manuscripts&#x2019; expert for Sotheby&#x2019;s auction house.&nbsp;<br><br> Journalist Sasha Abramsky re-creates here a lost world, bringing to life the people, the books, and the ideas that filled his grandparents&#x2019; house, from gatherings that included Eric Hobsbawm and Isaiah Berlin to books with Marx&#x2019;s handwritten notes, William Morris manuscripts and woodcuts, an early sixteenth-century Bomberg Bible, and a first edition of Descartes&#x2019;s <i>Meditations</i>. <i>The House of Twenty Thousand Books</i> is a wondrous journey through our times, from the vanished worlds of Eastern European Jewry to the cacophonous politics of modernity.<br><br><i>The House of Twenty Thousand Books </i>includes 43 photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Sasha Abramsky</b> was born in England, grew up in London, and attended Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied politics, philosophy, and economics.

[He] offers smart, concise pocket explanations of matters ranging from the effect of 18th-century French utopianism on leftist thinking to brief discourses on methodologies of Talmud study...Drawing on numerous interviews with Chimen&#x2019;s contemporaries and an impressively deep dive into the archives, the book grapples sensitively and honestly with how many of the conversations at 5 Hillway were conducted...In his grandson&#x2019;s loving, but intellectually responsible tribute, Chimen Abramsky has found his posterity.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Jeremy Dauber,&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <br><br>&#x201c;An evocative, often affecting and remarkably candid chronicle of Chimen [Abramsky&#x2019;s] life...One of the strategies I most admired about this book is that Sasha chooses to offer succinct essays about the ideas, historical events and personalities that animated his grandfather.

Chimen Abramsky is a worthy subject: his unorthodox intellectual approach and his awe-inspiring collection of books are both marvels to behold.

Appearing in English for the first time, The Collected Stories of Joseph Roth is a remarkable achievement, seventeen novellas and stories that echo the intensity and achievement of his greatest novel, The Radetzky March. Spanning the entire range of Roth's brief life (1894-1939) and including many stories just recently discovered, the book showcases the stunning "Strawberries" (1929), which comprises the first few chapters of a novel Roth would never complete. Here, clearly at the height of his literary prowess, Roth depicts his native town of Brody, a mad little Jewish village given over to mild criminality, yet oddly still ticking along. Similarly breathtaking, indeed reminiscent of Chekhov, are the novellas "Stationmaster Fallmerayer" (1933) and "The Bust of the Emperor" (1935). These short works, each a stunning example of Roth's legendary explorations of character, reflect an enduring and tragic sensibility that stands alone in the annals of twentieth-century fiction.</p><p><p><strong>Joseph Roth</strong> (1894-1939) was the great elegist of the cosmopolitan culture that flourished in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

She told us that Pim had asked her to switch it off and tiptoe upstairs. But you know what happens when you're trying to be quiet--the old stairs creaked twice as loud. Five minutes later Peter and Pim, the color drained from their faces, appeared again to relate their experiences.<br><br>They had positioned themselves under the staircase and waited. Nothing happened. Then all of a sudden they heard a couple of bangs, as if two doors had been slammed shut inside the house. Pim bounded up the stairs, while Peter went to warn Dussel, who finally presented himself upstairs, though not without kicking up a fuss and making a lot of noise. Then we all tiptoed in our stockinged feet to the van Daan family on the next floor. Mr. van D. had a bad cold and had already gone to bed, so we gathered around his bedside and discussed our suspicions in a whisper.<br><br>Every time Mr. van D. coughed loudly, Mrs. van D. and I nearly had a nervous fit. He kept coughing until someone came up with the bright idea of giving him codeine. His cough subsided immediately.<br><br>Once again we waited and waited, but heard nothing. Finally we came to the conclusion that the burglars had fled when they heard footsteps in an otherwise quiet building. The problem now was that the chairs in the private office were neatly grouped round the radio, which was tuned to England. If the burglars had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to notice it and call the police, that would get the ball rolling, and there could be very serious repercussions. So Mr. van Daan got up, pulled on his coat and pants, put on his hat and cautiously followed Father down the stairs, with Peter (armed with a heavy hammer, to be on the safe side) right behind him. The ladies (including Margot and me) waited in suspense until the men returned five minutes later and told us that there was no sign of any activity in the building. We agreed not to run any water or flush the toilet; but since everyone's stomach was churning from all the tension, you can imagine the stench after we'd each had a turn in the bathroom.<br><br>Incidents like these are always accompanied by other disasters, and this was no exception. Number one: the Westertoren bells stopped chiming, and they were always so comforting. Plus Mr. Voskuijl left early last night, and we weren't sure if he'd given Bep the key and she'd forgotten to lock the door.<br><br>Well, the night had just begun, and we still weren't sure what to expect. We were somewhat reassured by the fact that between eight-fifteen--when the burglar had first entered the building--and ten-thirty, we hadn't heard a sound. The more we thought about it, the less likely it seemed that a burglar would have forced a door so early in the evening, when there were still people out on the streets. Besides that, it occurred to us that the warehouse manager at the Keg Company next door might still have been at work. What with the excitement and the thin walls, it's easy to mistake the sounds. Besides, your imagination often plays tricks on you in moments of danger.<br><br>So we lay down on our beds, though not to sleep. Father and Mother and Mr. Dussel were awake most of the night, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I hardly got a wink of sleep. This morning the men went downstairs to see if the outside door was still locked, but all was well!<br><br>Of course, we gave the entire office staff a blow-by-blow account of the incident, which had been far from pleasant. It's much easier to laugh at these kinds of things after they've happened, and Bep was the only one who took us seriously.<br><br>Note: The next morning the toilet was clogged, and Father had to stick in a long wooden pole and fish out several pounds of excrement and strawberry recipes (which is what we use for toilet paper these days). Afterward we burned the pole.<br><br><b>The Dentist<br><br>Wednesday, December 8, 1942<br><br></b>The nicest spectacle I've ever seen here took place today: Mother was ironing and Mrs. van Daan was scheduled for a dental appointment. Dussel began unpacking his case with an air of importance (it was the first time he'd worked on anyone here), and he needed some eau de cologne, which could be used as a disinfectant, and vaseline, which would have to do for wax. Mrs. van D. sat down, and he started looking in her mouth, but every time he touched a tooth, the poor woman flinched and uttered incoherent cries. After a lengthy examination (lengthy as far as Mrs. van D. was concerned, since it actually took no longer than two minutes), Dussel began to scrape out a cavity. But Mrs. van D. had no intention of letting him. She flailed her arms and legs until Dussel finally let go of his probe and . . . it remained stuck in Mrs. van D.'s tooth. That really did it! Mrs. van D. lashed out wildly in all directions, cried (as much as you can with an instrument like that in your mouth), tried to remove it, but only managed to push it in even farther. Mr. Dussel calmly observed the scene, his hands on his hips, while the rest of the audience roared with laughter. Of course, that was very mean of us. If it'd been me, I'm sure I would have yelled even louder. After a great deal of squirming, kicking, screaming and shouting, she finally managed to yank the thing out, and Mr. Dussel calmly went on with his work as if nothing had happened. He was so quick that Mrs. van D. didn't have time to pull any more shenanigans. But then, he had more help than he's ever had before: no fewer than two assistants; Mr. van D. and I performed our job well. The whole scene resembled one of those engravings from the Middle Ages, the kind showing a quack at work. In the meantime, however, the patient was getting restless, since she had to keep an eye on "her" soup and "her" food. One thing is certain: Mrs. van D. will never make another dental appointment!<br><br><b>Sausage Day<br><br>Friday, December 10, 1942<br><br></b>Mr. van Daan had a large amount of meat. Today he wanted to make bratwurst and sausages, and tomorrow mettwurst. It's fun watching him put the meat through the grinder: once, twice, three times. Then he adds all kinds of ingredients to the meat and uses a long pipe, which he attaches to the grinder, to force it into the casings. We ate the bratwurst with sauerkraut (served with onions and potatoes) for lunch, but the sausages were hung to dry over a pole suspended from the ceiling. Everyone who came into the room burst into laughter when they saw those dangling sausages. It was such a comical sight.<br><br>The place was a shambles. Mr. van Daan, clad in his wife's apron and looking fatter than ever, was concentrating his hefty form on the meat. What with his bloody hands, red face and apron, he really looked like a butcher. Mrs. van D. was trying to do everything at once: learn Dutch, cook, watch, sigh, moan--she claims to have broken a rib. That's what happens when you do such stupid physical exercises. Dussel had an eye infection and was sitting next to the stove dabbing his eye with camomile tea. Pim, seated in the sunshine, kept having to move his chair this way and that to stay out of the way. His back must have been bothering him, because he was sitting slightly hunched over with an agonized expression on his face. He reminded me of those aged invalids you see in the poorhouse. Peter was romping around the room with the cat, holding out a piece of meat and then running off with the meat still in his hands. Mother, Margot and I were peeling potatoes. When you get right down to it, none of us were doing our work properly, because we were all so busy watching Mr. van Daan.<br><br><b>The Flea<br><br>Wednesday, July 7, 1943<br><br></b>We're being plagued with yet another problem: Mouschi's fleas. We didn't know that people could be bitten by cat fleas, but they can.<br><br>Yesterday when I was upstairs I found a flea on my leg, ten minutes later when I was downstairs I nabbed another one, and last night when I was sitting on Dussel's bed, I felt another one crawling down my leg, but the little critter slipped through my fingers--they're incredibly fast. This morning I was getting dressed over by the closet when I saw another one of those wondrous creatures, walking along as pretty as you please. A flea that walks as well as jumps is a new experience for me. I picked it up and squeezed as hard as I could, but Mr. Flea hopped away again. Sighing, I got undressed and subjected my naked body and my clothes to a thorough examination until I finally found the flea in my panties. A second later, it was off with his head.<br><br><b>Do You Remember?<br><br>Memories of my schooldays at the Jewish Lyceum<br><br></b>Do you remember? I've spent many a delightful hour talking about school, teachers, adventures and boys. Back when our lives were still normal, everything was so wonderful. That one year of Lyceum was heaven to me: the teachers, the things I learned, the jokes, the prestige, the crushes, the admirers.<br><br>Do you remember? When I came back from town that afternoon and found a package in the mailbox from "un ami, R." It could only have come from Rob Cohen.

Killingsworth has been, until the writing of this book, an unexamined genius of Southern California modernism. After his architectural education at USC and after service in the European theater of war in World War Two, Killingsworth settled into his home town of Long Beach and into an architectural practice that lasted almost half a century. His talents were quickly spotted by John Entenza, editor of Arts + Architecture magazine, and Killingsworth contributed much-admired projects to Entenza's influential Case Study House program. His calm and elegant post-and-beam structures have an almost Miesian grace, while they also embrace the new local model of modernism, fitting into the relaxed post-war indoor-outdoor ethos of Southern California. <br><br>But Killingsworth and his firm did much more. He contributed many plans and projects to Long Beach; had it survived, his calm and elegant Duffield Lincoln-Mercury Agency would be recognized as the masterpiece it was. In parallel to residential and commercial work, the Killingsworth firm were also pioneers in the planning and development of resort hotels around the Pacific Rim; two outstanding examples of these new inclusive resorts are the Kahala Hilton and the Bali Hilton. <br><br>Architectural historians Jennifer M. Volland and Cara Mullio recognized Killingsworth's importance while researching their first book, Long Beach Architecture: The Unexpected Metropolis (2005). They conducted interviews with Killingsworth himself and with his family and associates. They explored and organized the firm's extensive archives. A thorough, well-illustrated introduction posits Killingsworth, his family, and his firm in the Southern California milieu in which they thrived. This is followed by in-depth examinations of 42 of the most important projects the firm produced, from small residential pavilions to enormous hotel and resort developments. The entire book is profusely illustrated with photographs, renderings, plans, and elevations from the archives, almost all unseen before. With this work, Volland and Mullio have painted a rich portrait of Edward A. Killingsworth the man and the architect, and they have explored his particular design genius and placed him where he ultimately belongs, among the brightest stars of Southern California modernist architects.</p><p>Edward A. Killingsworth: An Architect's Life is the first monograph on prominent Southern California architect Edward Abel Killingsworth (1917&#x2013;2004). Best known for his involvement with John Entenza's Case Study House program, Killingsworth established his career mid-century with residential and commercial buildings that introduced a graceful and lightweight post-and-beam architecture. His firm's completion of the Kahala Hilton in Honolulu (1964) established an international reputation for innovative hotel and resort design. Concurrently involved in university work&#x2014;including forty-four years as master planner of the California State University, Long Beach, campus&#x2014;and important civic projects, the firm garnered numerous awards during its nearly five-decade existence for elegant small- and large-scale projects.</p><h2>The Last Thirteen: 12 (Book 2)</h2><p>13 Books. 13 Nightmares. 1 Destiny.

Her books Full Tilt, Eight Feet in the Andes, The Waiting Land, Muddling Through in Madagascar, On a Shoestring to Coorg, Cameroon with Egbert, Transylvannia and Beyond, The Ukimwi Road, and South from the Limpopo are available from The Overlook Press.This book recounts a trip, taken mostly on bicycle, by a gritty Irishwoman in 1963. Her route was through Yugoslavia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and ended in New Delhi. She carried a pistol, got sunstroke, and suffered the usual stomach disorders. She endured bad accommodations but reaped much local hospitality, too, including a dinner with the Pakistani president. Most of the book concerns the high mountain country of Afghanistan and Pakistan. First published in England in 1965, the book is neither current, nor quite old enough to be of much historical interest. Nonetheless, it is a spirited account, suitable for larger public library collections. Unfortunately, it lacks illustrations, and the two maps included give us little idea of the remote areas she visited. Harold M. Otness, Southern Oregon State Coll.

Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.&gt;</p><p>A widely influential work from one of the last century&#39;s most important thinkers, this is a profound attack on the materialism of contemporary society.Born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Erich Fromm (1900-1980) studied sociology and psychoanalysis. In 1933, he emigrated as a member of the Frankfurt School of social thinkers to the United States, moved to Mexico in 1950, and spent his twilight years between 1974 and 1980 in Switzerland. His books Fear of Freedom (1941) and The Art of Loving (1956) made him famous. Other well-known books are Marx&#39;s Concept of Man, Beyond the Chains of Illusion, and The Essential Fromm.</p><h2>Monster Manual 3: A 4th Edition D&amp;D Core Rulebook (Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th edition)</h2><p>Iconic monsters for your <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>� campaign<br><br>This core rulebook packs in over 200 new monsters to menace <b>D&amp;D</b>� player characters.

As the Irish people prepare to welcome President John F. Kennedy to the land of his ancestors, a German national is murdered in a seaside guesthouse. Lieutenant Albert Ryan, Directorate of Intelligence, is ordered to investigate. The German is the third foreigner to die within a few days, and Minister for Justice Charles Haughey wants the killing to end lest a shameful secret be exposed: the dead men were all Nazis granted asylum by the Irish government in the years following World War II.<br><br>A note from the killers is found on the dead German's corpse, addressed to Colonel Otto Skorzeny, Hitler's favorite commando, once called the most dangerous man in Europe. The note simply says: "We are coming for you."<br><br>As Albert Ryan digs deeper into the case he discovers a network of former Nazis and collaborators, all presided over by Skorzeny from his country estate outside Dublin. When Ryan closes in on the killers, his loyalty is torn between country and conscience. Why must he protect the very people he fought against twenty years before? Ryan learns that Skorzeny might be a dangerous ally, but he is a deadly enemy.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Stuart Neville and James R. Benn</b></p> <p><strong>Q. In one sentence, tell us what <i>Ratlines</i> is all about.</strong></p> <p>A. <i>Ratlines</i> is about Dublin intelligence officer Albert Ryan, tasked with finding the killers of several Nazis granted sanctuary in Ireland after World War II.</p> <p><strong>Q. Ratlines is your first foray into historical fiction. What was the different about writing a novel so heavily based on historical characters? Did your research or writing process vary from earlier works?</strong></p> <p>A. The research process was entirely different for <i>Ratlines</i> than for any other novel I&#x2019;ve written. With a present-day thriller, your research focuses on how things work; with a historical thriller, your focus is on how things were. For example, in my previous books, if I wanted to know how many rounds a Glock 17 can hold, I just downloaded the user manual from the manufacturer&#x2019;s website. Or if I need to get the layout of a part of town right, I can use Google Maps.</p> <p> Not so with <i>Ratlines</i>. Maps are of limited use because the layout of any given street can change, buildings can be renamed, and so on. There are events to get straight &#x2013; for example, the Irish bus drivers&#x2019; strike of 1963 is referenced in the book, as is JFK&#x2019;s visit to Ireland &#x2013; but there are also societal issues to think about. For those, it really helped to talk to people who were around Dublin in the early 60s. For example, I described the book&#x2019;s leading lady as wearing an off-the-shoulder dress in an early draft. Two beta readers pulled me up on that &#x2013; such a dress would have been scandalous in 60s Ireland. Now she keeps her shoulders covered.</p> <p><strong>Q. Irish Justice Minister Charles Haughey is a real-life character who appears in <i>Ratlines</i>. What should American readers, and others who have not heard of him, know about Charles Haughey? It seems that Irish and English readers have a reaction to the name. Is there a comparable American politician that might help us Yanks put him in context?</strong></p> <p>A. Charles Haughey is probably the most controversial figure in 20th Century Irish politics. He was a charismatic man, loved by many, but also hated. He was Irish prime minister three times, but ended his career in scandal when decades of corruption were exposed. I guess the nearest equivalent in American politics I can think of is a cross between Richard Nixon and Joseph P Kennedy Sr.</p> <p> Haughey was Minister for Justice at the time Ratlines is set, and as such was responsible for asylum seekers, including the Nazis and Axis collaborators who were in Ireland at the time. He&#x2019;s also known to have had an strange love-hate relationship with the British. He had the hatred of Britain that one would expect from an ardent Irish republican like Haughey, but he also seemed to regard himself as part of some imagined aristocracy, despite his lowly background, and identified himself with the English gentry.</p> <p><strong>Q. Otto Skorzeny&#x2014;a real-life scar-faced Nazi commando&#x2014;also has a major role. I wonder if this larger-than-life character ever threatened to take over the story. He's a guy you couldn't make up.</strong></p> <p>A. Otto Skorzeny was a real-life Bond villain, and truly larger than life. He could very easily have been cartoonish, and I couldn&#x2019;t help but play up some of his more theatrical quirks, including a fencing duel with the novel&#x2019;s protagonist. He was really a gift of a character.</p> <p><strong>Q. Breton nationalists in Ireland? Who knew? C�lestin Lain� is another remarkable, if unbalanced, real-life character. How did you find out about him, and are there still such guys living out their old age in Ireland?</strong></p> <p>A. I learned about Lain� initially through a documentary called <i>Ireland&#x2019;s Nazis</i> by journalist Cathal O&#x2019;Shannon. I dug further into him through Daniel Leach&#x2019;s book, <i>Fugitive Ireland</i>, also about Nazis and Axis collaborators harboured by the Irish state. The C�lestin Lain� in Ratlines is only very loosely based on the real life figure. When Lain� came to Ireland, he lived under his Breton name, Neven Henaff, but because the character in my book only really shares his history, I kept his original name. Similarly, the character of Catherine Beauchamp is based on Breton nationalist Francene Rozec, but only loosely, so I used one of her pen names for the book.</p> <p><strong>Q. Your previous books feature Jack Lennon, a Catholic detective in Northern Ireland. <i>Ratlines</i> features Albert Ryan, a Protestant cop in Dublin. What draws you to the outsider as main character?</strong></p> <p>A. That&#x2019;s a difficult question, and it might take a psychologist to answer it properly! I guess one theory might be that the reader is always an outsider to the world they&#x2019;re reading about, so it helps if the character whose eyes they&#x2019;re seeing through is also an outsider. It allows them to move through the story in a more dispassionate way, with a more objective view. I&#x2019;m not sure if that&#x2019;s really true, though...</p><p>Stuart Neville is the author of six other books: <i>Collusion</i>, a finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize; <i>Stolen Souls</i>, which <i>The Guardian </i>said &#x201c;confirms him as the king of Belfast noir&#x201d;; <i>The Final Silence</i>, a nominee for the Edgar Award for Best Novel; <i>Those We Left Behind</i>, a <i>New York Times </i>and <i>Boston Globe </i>Best Crime Novel of the Year; <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i>, winner of the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize and a finalist for the Macavity Award, the Barry Award, and the Anthony Award for Best First Novel; and <i>So Say the Fallen</i>.

I must again come to some relationship to God that will enable me to pursue my career as an outward manifestation of inwardly held values.</p> <p>In other words, what needs mending here is probably not the outward form&#x2014; I suspect that after a great deal of soul-searching I would still come back to being a writer and a teacher&#x2014;but the inward connection. I must feel I am doing what God would have me do.</p> <p>To be comforted, I must feel connected to God and that I am acting out of some inner sense of guidance. Guidance is what is missing right now. I feel that I have come so far and suddenly, <i>pfft</i>, God is missing. I know that the phrase for the period I am in is "dark night of the soul," but that seems very dramatic for what is essentially a broad daylight problem. It is three o'clock on a dreary, gray early autumn day and I do not know where God is.</p> <p>It seems to me it takes faith to say "God is right here. Right now. Right where we are." To do that is to assume that no mistakes have been made. But maybe no mistakes have been made or, if mistakes have been made, they must be able to be unmade. God, merciful God, must be able to incline Himself to the exact point, here, where we are crying in the wilderness.</p> <p>And so' because there is no point in positing God as misplaced, let us assume God is right where God is supposed to be, right where we are. Here. Now. In the midst. If God is right here, then what is my problem?</p> <p>My problem then comes back to faith. God is here, but I do not believe God is here. I do not believe, but that does not mean I am right. I may very well be blind to God right now. God may be everywhere, all around me, completely involved and infusing all of my affairs and I still might just miss His presence if what is going on is somehow counter to my sense of God or godliness. If I cannot see how and why God is using me as he does, then I stubbornly find myself thinking that there must again be some mistake and I must have lost God somehow. I turned left and God turned right. I went north while God went south.</p> <p>Ah, but I have not.</p> <p>God is our milieu, every compass point, our entire universe. God cannot be misplaced. Then it follows that everything is in divine order and that I am exactly where I am supposed to be, feeling exactly what it is I am supposed to be feeling&#x2014; which is lost. Why, God, must I feel lost?</p> <p>There must be some purpose to my feeling lost. If it is God's will for me to be wandering without a compass, there must be some point to such meanderings. God, where are you? I ask, and in the question there must be some worth because God's will is not purposeless. God has intentions for us and the one intention that I can see in my current dilemma is that God must wa nt me to grow and to grow toward God. Well, I am trying. I am sending stalks out blindly, like a plant seeking the light and groping upward.</p> <p>"God, where are you, God?"</p> <p>"I am right here," I can imagine God answering me, so real I must report it. "I am in the very air you breathe. I sit with you at your desk. I look outward with you to regard your vista. I am not lost. I am not missing."</p> <p>If God is not missing, then why is my sense of God missing? It may be something as simple as "absence makes the heart grow fonder" and God is growing me a fonder heart. For my own good. I could use a fonder heart. I could enjoy</p> <p>having a heart more fondly open to God and more open to seeing God in all I encounter. Surely, living in New York as I do and encountering great crowds of people as I do' it would be comforting to see the eyes of God looking outward from each face.</p> <p>"Now you are onto something," I can hear God saying&#x2014;almost.</p> <p>If I let myself, I can imagine how God might talk with me, gently, as though trying not to startle a child. "Here I am," I can hear God saying to me,"not lost at all, just misplaced by you. Why do you need to have such a sense of emergency?"</p> <p>When I have a sense of God, there is no sense of emergency. There is a sense of wonder and calm unfolding. Then I can watch my life as time-lapse photography and see the great good being brought to bear simply because I am practicing enough patience and faith to let God have his way with me. I am cooperating. That is, co-operating.</p> <p>When I have a sense of God, there is a sense of synchronicity. All things work toward the good, and I am able to see that good when I look with the eyes of faith. But the eyes of faith are blinded right now. I grope in the darkness. Again, I can hear God saying to me, "What darkness? I am right beside you. See things in my light."</p> <p>The light of God is the light of optimism, the light of hope. The light of God sees all things as potential good. The light of God sees things being made right, and again, more right. The light of God sees all creation as ever coming more perfectly into form&#x2014; and that includes myself. "I am on the right track," the eyes of faith tell me. They see visible progress and they report to me what they see. "You are well and carefully led."</p> <p>The light of God is a beacon and we need not be blind to it. I can use it like a flashlight to examine my life and to ask that I be pointed toward the good. There is always some corner of my life that is still dark, some area that is still being run by self-will that can yet be surrendered to God. Take money. In my time I have made a great deal of money. I would like to keep on making money, a great deal of money. This is an area where I do not want to let God run my life for me. I am afraid lest his will for me be less abundant. And so I say, "Sure, God, you can run the seasons and the planets and this green earth, but you cannot run my financial affairs." You see where my faith has holes in it.</p> <p>And yet a faith with holes in it is better than no faith at all and that is the terrifying point that I have come to lately. I have misplaced my faith. I search for it with both hands but cannot lay hold of it. I have faith, surely I have faith in something, but faith in what? God must be the great reality and we must somehow live our life relative to that. We must on some level be able to grasp God. God must on some level be real as bread.</p> <p>Two months a year I go to New Mexico. God is real in New Mexico. Clearly visible as the Sacred Mountain or as the clouds that wreathe it. God is in the vast horizons and the far peaks. God is in the snowy crags, the cascading mountain streams, the hawks that ride the thermals. God is everywhere and God is glorious. The Great Creator shows forth in his creation. In New Mexico it is easy to believe.</p> <p>But ten months a year I live in New York City. God must be just as real in New York. God doesn't choose to live only in scenic beauty. God is everywhere. God is on the crowded street. God is visible in the faces of strangers. God is in place and active in all human affairs. God is in the skyscraper. God is on the brownstone stoop. At the deli. At the newsstand. On the subway platform.</p> <p>In order to find God, we must look for God and we must begin that looking in our own heart. "God? Are you there?"</p> <p>"Of course I am here," I can hear God answering, but is that answer just my comfortable imagination?</p> <p>How can we know when God is real and answering? Must we be content with "It seems to me"? Is conscious contact one-sided?</p> <p>Every morning I seek to find God. I do it by writing three pages of long-hand writing, a position statement. "Here is where I am, God. Can you find me?" Every morning I find enough of God to go forward. I state where I am and I believe that somewhere the Great Something is listening and responds back. There are other ways to pray. Some people start their days with small books, daily reminders of God. Other people start with sitting meditation. Some people start with both. We are all looking for God, looking for a connection that will feel real enough to get us through the day. What we are seeking is a sense of companionship and connection.</p> <p>God as daily. God as guidance.</p> <p>How do we know if we are being guided by God? How do we know if we are moving in the right direction? There is an inner sense of rightness, a feeling that all may yet be puzzling yet all is well. When we are being guided by God, we may not know what step to take months from now, but we will know, usually, the next right step and, taking that step, we again know the next right step that follows. Rarely are we given great bolts of knowledge. God's will comes to us in daily increments, "Do this next."</p> <p>There are ways that we can romance knowledge of God's will for us. We can take walks, asking God to companion us. On these walks we may feel a strong sense of connection and direction. Walking is simple. Walking is doable. We all do it and we can all do more of it, talking with God.</p> <p>We can also take ourselves to the page. Writing yields clarity. There is something in moving our hand across the page that can also help to make God's will visible to us. "I don't know what to do'" we write. "It seems to me I should try X." Then, a little later, "I could also try Y." In seeing our alternatives, we can sometimes see the face of God. We are not powerless. We are not choiceless. We are not trapped. We do have dignity. All of this can be revealed by time at the page.</p> <p>There is a way to live each day that feels in accord with God's will for us. We may act differently at the office. We may be kind to a stranger boarding a bus. Riding crosstown, we might view the leafy green canopy of Central Park and resolve that next time we will walk. All of these choices are points where our life touches God's. God touches our lives everywhere and at all times.</p> <p>The great question is not "Where is God?" but "Where am I?" Am I pretending that God cannot see me or hear me? Am I pretending to be living a life without God? Most of us do that most of the time. Take me. I am writing and I am wondering what to write next.</p> <p>Am I asking?</p> <p>If God is with us every moment, then we can ask for direction at all times. There will never be a moment in which our prayer is unheard, although we may hurry onward, not taking time for the answer. To know God takes a beat. We must reach out and allow the time to feel that what we have reached out to has reached out back to us. Most of us are too hurried to know God. And yet we act as if God is too hurried to know us.</p> <p>Most of the time we have it inside out. We complain that God has abandoned us when it is we who have abandoned God. God is waiting for us at all times, at all moments. God is always there ready for us to make contact and willing, when we make contact, to make contact back.</p> <p>"God, are you there?"</p> <p>"Of course I am here."</p> <p>Let us start with this idea: "Of course, I am here."</p> <p>If God is always there and always available, then we are the ones who lag behind. Perhaps we do what I do and tag base with God only in the morning, forgetting about God the rest of the day, just going from thing to thing without taking God into account. Is it possible that in light of this, God gets lonely? Is it possible that God misses us? I think it is possible. I think that God is always glad to hear from us.</p> <p>"Of course I am glad to hear from you."</p> <p>Was that thought God or just wishful thinking?</p> <p>I began this writing by saying that I was estranged from God, and yet I notice how quickly that sense of estrangement passes as I try, however feebly, to be honest and to reach toward God. Perhaps God does not make difficult terms for us. Perhaps we are the ones who make difficult terms for God. Perhaps we are the ones who are so afraid to believe that we believe in our disbelief. Why are we afraid of being gullible? Why are we afraid of being na�ve? Why are we afraid of being believers? Is it too much for us&#x2014; the degree of comfort we can take&#x2014; if we believe we are on the right track and trying to find God?</p> <p>Perhaps it is.</p> <p>It is easy to be addicted to anxiety. It is easy to make worry our home vibration. The world, after all, is tuned to anxiety and worry. We need only switch on CNN to be aware that anxiety is what we are being tutored in. We need only glance at a headline to realize that the "news," as we are trained to perceive it, is all bad news. But what if this news is only half the news? What if good news is as real as bad?</p><p>What if God really is the good news?</p> <p>What if God is real and our attempts to reach God are enough? What if there is no hard test to be passed, no high quotient of misery we are required to undergo? What if there really is a benevolent God, one that will try to work with us as we labor to work with him? What if the harmony that we see in the natural world is possible also in the world of human affairs? What if we can move toward this harmony by simply trying to move toward God? What if the trying is enough? What if God does not play hide and seek with us but stands ready and available for all who seek contact?</p> <p>What if God really is the Great Comforter?</p> <p>What if all that stands between us and God is us?</p> <p>We are back to the same bottom line. If I am uncomfortable, and I am, then what can be done about it? If I have trouble believing, how can I believe? What we are talking about here is "conscious contact," a reliable, <i>felt </i>sense that we are in touch with God and God is in touch with us. Probably the first portal to God comes with slowing down, taking the time in the morning to link up with God, to place our day in God's hands, however we can conceptualize our doing that. For me, writing the three Morning Pages is the way I "turn things over." For others, it may be a more formal prayer: "God, I offer myself to Thee to build with me and do with me what Thou wilt." For still others, it may be more Zen, a quiet period of sitting meditation in which nothing is articulated but everything is somehow addressed and eased. It matters less how you try to link up with God than that you try to link up with God. It doesn't matter that you didn't do it yesterday and that you may forget again to do it tomorrow. What matters is today, the one day that we have got with any certainty. Just for today, I am going to reach out toward God. Just for today, I am going to act as if I am a believer.</p> <p>The key words <i>conscious contact </i>give us many clues. First of all, we must bring God to our consciousness. We must be aware of God. God must become a variable in our life, Something or Somebody...</p></i></p><h2>Admiral Arleigh Burke</h2><p>Describes his achievements as a commander of a destroyer squadron in the Solomon Islands during World War II, his postwar advancement, and his accomplishments as chief of naval operations</p><p>The late E.B. Potter, a longtime history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and former naval officer who served in the Pacific during World War II, is the author of several books, including <i>Nimitz, Admiral Arleigh Burke</i>, and <i>Sea Power: A Naval History</i>, which he wrote with Admiral Nimitz.One of the military's most colorful figures, and the last surviving WW II naval commander, "31-Knot Burke" was a destroyer captain in the Solomons campaign, served as Admiral Marc Mitscher's chief of staff in the final two years of the war and, in 1955, was chosen over 91 senior admirals as Chief of Naval Operations. Retiring after four decades of active service in 1961, Burke became co-founder and director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University. Potter, former chairman of naval history at the U.S. Naval Academy, has written an entertaining biography of a talented and resourceful officer who was instrumental in the development of the missile-armed, nuclear-propelled navy. Of particular interest is Potter's clarifying account of the controversy over unification of the armed services in the late 1940s and Burke's role in the so-called "Revolt of the Admirals."

A loaded gun. Trouble with the possibility of rubble.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just need to get back to school, around all my friends.&#x201d;<br> <br>Whenever I quoted shrinks to her, Mom relaxed somewhat, as if it was proof that I&#x2019;d actually listened to them.<br> <br>I could remember a lot of what the docs said&#x2014;because they&#x2019;d made me forget so much of my life before the clinic.<br> <br>With her hands clasped behind her back, Mom began strolling around my room, her gaze flickering over my belongings&#x2014;a pretty, blond Sherlock Holmes sniffing for any secrets she didn&#x2019;t yet know.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d find nothing; I&#x2019;d already hidden my contraband in my book bag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you have a nightmare last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>Had she heard me shoot upright with a cry? &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When you were catching up with your friends, did you confide to anyone where you really were?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom and I had told everyone that I&#x2019;d gone to a special school for &#x201c;deportment.&#x201d; After all, you can&#x2019;t prep a daughter too early for those competitive sororities in the South.<br> <br>In reality, I&#x2019;d been locked up at the Children&#x2019;s Learning Center, a behavioral clinic for kids. Also known as Child&#x2019;s Last Chance.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told <i>anyone</i> about CLC,&#x201d; I said, horrified by the idea of my friends, or my boyfriend, finding out.<br> <br>Especially not him. Brandon Radcliffe. With his hazel eyes, movie-star grin, and curling light-brown hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. It&#x2019;s our business only.&#x201d; She paused before my room&#x2019;s big wall mural, tilting her head uneasily. Instead of a nice watercolor or a retro-funk design, I&#x2019;d painted an eerie landscape of tangled vines, looming oaks, and darkening skies descending over hills of cane. I knew she&#x2019;d considered painting over the mural but feared I&#x2019;d reach my limit and mutiny.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you taken your medicine this morning?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I always do, Mom.&#x201d; Though I couldn&#x2019;t say my bitter little pills had done much for my nightmares, they did stave off the delusions that had plagued me last spring.<br> <br>Those terrifying hallucinations had been so lifelike, leaving me temporarily blinded to the world around me. I&#x2019;d barely completed my sophomore year, brazening out the visions, training myself to act like nothing was wrong.<br> <br>In one of those delusions, I&#x2019;d seen flames blazing across a night sky. Beneath the waves of fire, fleeing rats and serpents had roiled over Haven&#x2019;s front lawn, until the ground looked like it was rippling.<br> <br>In another, the sun had shone&#x2014;at night&#x2014;searing people&#x2019;s eyes till they ran with pus, mutating their bodies and rotting their brains. They became zombielike blood drinkers, with skin that looked like crinkled paper bags and oozed a rancid slime. I called them <i>bogeymen</i>. . . .<br> <br>My short-term goal was simple: Don&#x2019;t get exiled back to CLC. My long-term goal was a bit more challenging: Survive the rest of high school so I could escape to college.<br> <br>&#x201c;And you and Brandon are still an item?&#x201d; Mom almost sounded disbelieving, as if she didn&#x2019;t understand why he would still be going out with me after my three-month absence.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be here soon,&#x201d; I said in an insistent tone. Now she&#x2019;d gotten me nervous.<br> <br>No, no. All summer, he&#x2019;d faithfully texted me, though I&#x2019;d only been allowed to respond twice a month. And ever since my return last week, he&#x2019;d been wonderful&#x2014;my cheerful, smiling boyfriend bringing me flowers and taking me to movies.<br> <br>&#x201c;I like Brandon. He&#x2019;s such a good boy.&#x201d; At last, Mom concluded this morning&#x2019;s interrogation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re back, honey. It&#x2019;s been so quiet around Haven without you.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Quiet?</i> I yearned to say, &#x201c;Really, Karen? You know what&#x2019;s worse than quiet? Fluorescent bulbs crackling twenty-four hours a day in the center. Or maybe the sound of my cutter roommate weeping as she attacked her thigh with a spork? How about disconnected laughter with no punch line?&#x201d;<br> <br>But then, that last one had been me.<br> <br>In the end, I said nothing about the center. <i>Just two years and out.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, I&#x2019;ve got a big day.&#x201d; I shouldered my backpack. &#x201c;And I want to be outside when Brand shows.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d already made him wait for me all summer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, of course.&#x201d; She shadowed me down the grand staircase, our steps echoing in unison. At the door, she tucked my hair behind my ears and gave me a kiss on my forehead, as if I were a little girl. &#x201c;Your shampoo smells nice&#x2014;might have to borrow some.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; I forced another smile, then walked outside. The foggy air was so still&#x2014;as if the earth had exhaled but forgotten to inhale once more.<br> <br>I descended the front steps, then turned to gaze at the imposing home I&#x2019;d missed so much.<br> <br>Haven House was a grand twenty-two-room mansion, fronted by twelve stately columns. Its colors&#x2014;wood siding of the lightest cream, hurricane shutters of the darkest forest green&#x2014;had remained unchanged since it&#x2019;d originally been built for my great-great-great-great-grandmother.<br> <br>Twelve massive oak trees encircled the structure, their sprawling limbs grown together in places, like hundred-ton hydras trapping prey.<br> <br>The locals thought Haven House looked haunted. Seeing the place bathed in fog, I had to admit that was fair.<br> <br>As I waited, I meandered across the front lawn to a nearby cane row, leaning in to smell a purple stalk. Crisp but sweet. One of the feathery green leaves was curled so that it looked like it was embracing my hand. That made me smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get rain soon,&#x201d; I murmured, hoping Sterling&#x2019;s drought would finally end.<br> <br>My smile deepened when I saw a sleek Porsche convertible speeding down our oystershell drive, a blur of red.<br> <br>Brandon. He was the most enviable catch in our parish. Senior. Quarterback. Rich. The trifecta of boyfriends.<br> <br>When he pulled up, I opened the passenger door with a grin. &#x201c;Hey, big guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>But he frowned. &#x201c;You look . . . tired.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get to bed till late,&#x201d; I replied, darting a glance over my shoulder as I tossed my bag into the minuscule backseat. When the kitchen curtain fluttered to the side, I just stopped myself from rolling my eyes. <i>Two years and out . . .</i><br> <br>&#x201c;You feeling okay?&#x201d; His gaze was filled with concern. &#x201c;We can pick up some coffee on the way.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shut the door behind me. &#x201c;Sure. Whatever.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t complimented me on my hair or outfit&#x2014;my Chlo� baby-blue sleeveless dress with the hem no more than four regulation inches above the knee, the silky black ribbon that held my hair back in a curling ponytail, my matching black Miu Miu ankle-wrap heels.<br> <br>My diamond earrings and Patek Philippe wristwatch served as my only jewelry.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d spent weeks planning this outfit, two days in Atlanta acquiring it, and the last hour convincing myself I&#x2019;d never looked better.<br> <br>He hiked his wide shoulders, the matter forgotten, then peeled down Haven&#x2019;s drive, tires spitting up an arc of shell fragments as we zoomed past acre after acre of cane.<br> <br>Once we&#x2019;d reached the highway, a seamed and worn-out stretch of old Louisiana road, he said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so quiet this morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had weird dreams last night.&#x201d; Nightmares. Nothing new there.<br> <br>Without fail, my good dreams were filled with plants. I&#x2019;d see ivy and roses growing before my eyes or crops sprouting all around me.<br> <br>But lately in my nightmares, a crazed redheaded woman with gleaming green eyes used those same plants to . . . hurt people, in grisly ways. When her victims begged for mercy, she would cackle with delight.<br> <br>She was cloaked and partially hooded, so I couldn&#x2019;t make out all of her face, but she had pale skin and green ivylike tattoos running down both her cheeks. Her wild red hair was strewn with leaves.<br> <br>I called her the red witch. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said with a shiver. &#x201c;They kind of put me in a funk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; His demeanor told me he felt way out of his depth. I&#x2019;d once asked him if he had nightmares, and he&#x2019;d looked at me blankly, unable to remember one.<br> <br>That was the thing about Brandon&#x2014;he was the most happy-go-lucky boy I&#x2019;d ever met. Though he was built like a bear&#x2014;or a pro football player&#x2014;his temperament was more adoring canine than grizzly.<br> <br>Secretly, I put a lot of store in him, hoping his normal could drag me back from my wasteland-visions brink. Which was why I&#x2019;d fretted about him finding another girl and breaking up with me while I was locked up at CLC.<br> <br>Now it seemed like at least one thing was going to work out. Brandon had stayed true to me. With every mile we drove away from Haven, the sun shone brighter and brighter, the fog lifting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I know how to put my girl in a good mood.&#x201d; He gave me his mischievous grin.<br> <br>I was helpless not to be charmed. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, big guy? How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He pulled off the road under the shade of a pecan tree, tires popping the fallen pecans. After waiting for the dust to pass us, he pressed a button and put down the convertible top. &#x201c;How fast you wanna go, Eves?&#x201d;<br> <br>Few things exhilarated me more than flying down the highway with the top down. For about a nanosecond I considered how to repair the utter loss of my hairstyling&#x2014;<i>braid a loose fishtail over your shoulder</i>&#x2014;then told him, &#x201c;Kick her in the guts.&#x201d;<br> <br>He peeled out, the engine purring with power. Hands raised, I threw my head back and yelled, &#x201c;Faster!&#x201d;<br> <br>At each gear, he redlined before shifting, until the car stretched her legs. As houses whizzed past, I laughed with delight.<br> <br>The months before were a dim memory compared to this&#x2014;the sun, the wind, Brandon sliding me excited grins. He was right; this was just what I needed.<br> <br>Leave it to my teddy bear of a football player to make me feel carefree and sane again.<br> <br>And didn&#x2019;t that deserve a kiss?<br> <br>Unbuckling my seat belt, I clambered up on my knees, tugging my dress up a couple of inches so I could lean over to him. I pressed my lips against the smooth-shaven skin of his cheek. &#x201c;Just what the doctor ordered, Brand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know it!&#x201d;<br> <br>I kissed his broad jaw, then&#x2014;as my experienced best friend Melissa had instructed&#x2014;I nuzzled his ear, letting him feel my breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Evie,&#x201d; he rasped. &#x201c;You drive me crazy, you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was getting an idea. I knew I played with fire, teasing him like this. He&#x2019;d already been reminding me of a promise I&#x2019;d made right before I left for <i>deportment school</i>: If we were still going out when I turned sixteen (I was a <i>young</i> junior), I would play my V card. My birthday was next Monday&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell does that guy want?&#x201d; he suddenly exclaimed.<br> <br>I drew my head back from Brandon, saw he was glancing past me. I darted a look back, and my stomach plummeted.<br> <br>A guy on a motorcycle had pulled up right next to us, keeping pace with the car, checking me out. His helmet had a tinted visor so I couldn&#x2019;t see his face, but I knew he was staring at my ass.<br> <br>First instinct? Drop my butt in the seat, willing my body to disappear into the upholstery. Second instinct? Stay where I was and glare at the pervert. This was <i>my</i> morning, my laughter, my fast drive in my boyfriend&#x2019;s luxury sports car.<br> <br>After a summer spent in a fluorescent hell, I <i>deserved</i> this morning.<br> <br>When I twisted around to glare over my shoulder, I saw the guy&#x2019;s helmet had dipped, attention definitely on my ass. Then he slowly raised his head, as if he was raking his gaze over every inch of me.<br> <br>It felt like hours passed before he reached my eyes. I tugged my hair off my face, and we stared at each other for so long that I wondered when he was going to run off the road.<br> <br>Then he gave me a curt nod and sped past us, expertly dodging a pothole. Two more motorcycles followed, each carrying two people. They honked and cheered, while Brandon&#x2019;s face turned as red as his car.<br> <br>I consoled myself with the knowledge that I&#x2019;d probably never have to see them again.</p><h2>Revan (Star Wars: The Old Republic, Vol. 3)</h2><p><b><i>There&#x2019;s something out there:</i></b><br><b><i>a juggernaut of evil bearing down to crush the Republic&#x2014;</i></b><br><b><i>unless one lone Jedi, shunned and reviled, can stop it.</i></b><br><br>Revan: hero, traitor, conqueror, villain, savior.

Storms were common here on Dromund Kaas; dark clouds perpetually blocked out the sun, rendering terms like day and night meaningless. The only natural illumination came from the frequent bursts of lightning arcing across the sky, but the glow from the spaceport and nearby Kaas City provided more than enough light to see where he was going.<br><br>The powerful electrical storms were a physical manifestation of the dark side power that engulfed the entire planet--a power that had brought the Sith back here a millennium before, when their very survival had been in doubt.<br><br>After a crushing defeat in the Great Hyperspace War, the Emperor had risen up from the tattered ranks of the remaining Sith Lords to lead his followers on a desperate exodus to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. Fleeing the Republic armies and the relentless revenge of the Jedi, they eventually resettled far beyond the borders of Republic-charted space on their long-lost ancestral homeworld.<br><br>There, safely hidden from their enemies, the Sith began to rebuild their Empire. Under the guidance of the Emperor--the immortal and all-powerful savior who still reigned over them even after a thousand years--they abandoned the hedonistic lifestyles of their barbaric ancestors.<br><br>Instead they created a near-perfect society in which the Imperial military operated and controlled virtually every aspect of daily life. Farmers, mechanics, teachers, cooks, janitors--all were part of the great martial machine, each individual a cog trained to perform his or her duties with maximum discipline and efficiency. As a result, the Sith had been able to conquer and enslave world after world in the unexplored regions of the galaxy, until their power and influence rivaled those of their glorious past.<br><br>Another burst of lightning split the sky, momentarily illuminating the massive citadel that loomed over Kaas City. Built by slaves and devoted followers, the citadel served as both palace and fortress, an unassailable meeting place for the Emperor and the twelve handpicked Sith Lords who made up his Dark Council.<br><br>A decade earlier, when Scourge had first arrived on Dromund Kaas as a young apprentice, he had vowed to one day set foot inside the citadel's exclusive halls. Yet in all his years of training at the Sith Academy on Kaas City's borders, he had never been granted the privilege. He had been one of the top students, marked by his superiors for his strength in the Force and his fanatic devotion to the ways of the Sith. But acolytes were not permitted inside the citadel; its secrets were reserved for those in direct service to the Emperor and the Dark Council.<br><br>The dark side power emanating from within the building was undeniable; he had felt the raw, crackling energy every day during his years as an acolyte. He had drawn on it, focusing his mind and spirit to channel the power through his own body to sustain him during the brutal training sessions.<br><br>Now, after almost two years away, he was back on Dromund Kaas. Standing on the landing pad, he could once again feel the dark side deep inside his bones, the sizzling heat more than compensating for the minor discomfort of the wind and rain. But he was no longer a mere apprentice. Scourge had returned to the seat of Imperial power as a full-fledged Sith Lord.<br><br>He had known this day would come eventually. After graduating from the Sith Academy he had hoped for a posting on Dromund Kaas. Instead he had been sent to the fringes of the Empire to help quell a series of minor rebellions on recently conquered worlds. Scourge suspected the posting had been a punishment of some type. One of his instructors, jealous of the star pupil's potential, had probably recommended that he be stationed as far from the seat of Imperial power as possible to slow his ascent to the upper ranks of Sith society.<br><br>Unfortunately, Scourge had no proof to back his theory. Yet even exiled to the uncivilized sectors on the farthest borders of the Empire, he had still managed to forge his reputation. His martial skills and ruthless pursuit of the rebel leaders caught the notice of several prominent military leaders. Now, two years after leaving the Academy, he had returned to Dromund Kaas as a newly anointed Lord of the Sith. More important, he was here at the personal request of Darth Nyriss, one of the most senior members of the Emperor's Dark Council.<br><br>"Lord Scourge," a figure called out over the wind, running up to greet him. "I am Sechel. Welcome to Dromund Kaas."<br><br>"Welcome back," Scourge corrected as the man dropped to one knee and bowed his head in a gesture of respect. "This is not my first time on this world."<br><br>Sechel's hood was pulled up against the rain, covering his features, but during his approach Scourge had noticed the red skin and dangling cheek tendrils that marked him as a pureblood Sith, just like Lord Scourge himself. But while Scourge was an imposing figure, tall and broad-shouldered, this man was small and slight. Reaching out, Scourge sensed only the faintest hint of the Force in the other, and his features twisted into a sneer of revulsion.<br><br>Unlike the humans that made up the bulk of the Empire's population, the Sith species were all blessed with the power of the Force to varying degrees. It marked them as the elite; it elevated them above the lower ranks of Imperial society. And it was a legacy that was fervently protected.<br><br>A pureblood born without any connection to the Force was an abomination; by custom such a creature could not be suffered to live. During his time at the Academy, Lord Scourge had encountered a handful of Sith whose power in the Force was noticeably weak. Hampered by their failing, they relied on the influence of their high-ranking families to find them postings as low-level aids or administrative officials at the Academy, where their handicap would be least noticed. Spared from the lower castes only by their pureblood heritage, in Scourge's eyes they were barely better than slaves, though he did have to admit that the more competent ones could have their uses.<br><br>But never before had he encountered one of his own kind with as feeble an attunement to the Force as the man huddled at his feet. The fact that Darth Nyriss had sent someone so vile and unworthy to greet him was unsettling. He'd expected a more substantial and impressive welcome.<br><br>"Get up," he snarled, making no effort to conceal his disgust.<br><br>Sechel quickly scrambled to his feet. "Darth Nyriss sends her apologies for not coming to meet you personally," he said quickly. "There have been several attempts on her life recently, and she only leaves her palace under the rarest of circumstances."<br><br>"I'm well aware of her situation," Scourge replied.<br><br>"Y-yes, my lord," Sechel stammered. "Of course. That's why you're here. Excuse my stupidity."<br><br>A crash of thunder nearly drowned out Sechel's apology, heralding an increase in the storm's intensity. The driving rain started to come down in stinging sheets.<br><br>"Were your Master's instructions to leave me standing here in this downpour until I drowned?" Scourge demanded.<br><br>"F-forgive me, my lord. Please, follow me. We have a speeder waiting to take you to the domicile."<br><br>A short distance from the spaceport was a small landing pad. A constant stream of hovercabs was landing and taking off--the preferred way for those of the lower ranks who couldn't afford their own speeder to traverse the city. As was typical at a busy spaceport, a thick crowd surrounded the base of the landing pad. Those just arriving quickly fell into the queues waiting to hire a driver, moving with the disciplined precision that was the hallmark of Imperial society.<br><br>Of course, Lord Scourge had no need to step into the line. While some in the crowd cast sharp glances at Sechel as he tried to force a path through, the throng quickly parted upon catching sight of the towering figure behind him. Even with his hood drawn against the rain, Scourge's black cape, his spiked armor, his dark red complexion, and the lightsaber prominently displayed at his side clearly marked him as a Sith Lord.<br><br>The individuals in the crowd showed a wide variety of reactions to his presence. Many were slaves or indentured servants out running errands for their masters; they wisely kept their eyes fixed on the ground, careful not to make eye contact. The Enlisted--the ranks of ordinary individuals conscripted into mandatory military service--snapped smartly to attention, as if waiting for Scourge to inspect them as he passed by.<br><br>The Subjugates--the caste of offworld merchants, traders, dignitaries, and visitors from planets not yet granted full status in the Empire--stared with a mixture of wonder and fear as they stepped quickly aside. Many of them bowed as a sign of respect. On their homeworlds they might be rich and powerful, but here on Dromund Kaas they were well aware that they ranked only slightly above the servants and slaves.<br><br>The only exception to the rule was a pair of humans, one male, the other female. Scourge noticed them standing at the foot of the stairs leading up to the landing pad, stubbornly holding their ground.<br><br>They were wearing expensive clothes--matching red pants and tops trimmed with white--and both clearly wore light armor beneath their outfits. Dangling from the man's shoulder was a large assault rifle, and the woman had a blaster pistol strapped across each hip. However, the two humans were clearly not part of the military, as neither displayed the official Imperial insignia or any indication of rank on their garb.<br><br>It wasn't unusual for Subjugate mercenaries from other worlds to visit Dromund Kaas. Some came seeking profit, hiring their services out to the highest bidder; others came to prove their value to the Empire in the hope of one day being granted the rare privilege of full Imperial citizenship. But mercenaries typically reacted with deference and humility when co...</p><h2>The Emerald City of Oz (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>[The King, wanting some advice from his Chief Counselor, called for him, explained his problem and then listened to the Counselor's suggestion.] Hearing this, the King glared at his Counselor with a furious expression and tugged at his own long white whiskers until he pulled them so hard that he yelled with pain.<br>"You are a fool!" he exclaimed.<br>"I share that honor with your Majesty," said the Chief Counselor.<br>Long-time fans of the Land of Oz will find this gentle humor familiar.

Behind her trademark sunglasses and under the fringe of her Louise Brooks bob she determines whether miniskirts are in or out, whether or not it's politically correct to wear fur. She influences designers, wholesalers, and retailers globally from Seventh Avenue to the elegant fashionista enclaves of L'Avenue Montaigne and Via della Spiga. In the U.S. alone a more than $200 billion fashion industry can rise or fall on Anna Wintour's call. And every month millions of women-and men-read <i>Vogue</i>, and are influenced by the pages of the chic and trendy style wish-book that she has controlled with an iron hand in a not-always-so-velvet glove since fighting her way to the most prestigious job in fashion journalism.<br><br>Anna Wintour's fashion influence extends to celebrities and politicians: because of it, Hillary Clinton underwent a drastic makeover and became the first First Lady to strike a pose on the cover of <i>Vogue</i> in the midst of Monicagate; Oprah Winfrey was forced to go on a strict diet before Wintour would put her on <i>Vogue</i>'s cover. And beauties like Rene Zellweger and Nicole Kidman follow Anna Wintour's fashionista rules to the letter.<br><br>Now in her mid-fifties, as she nears her remarkable second decade at the helm of <i>Vogue</i>, comes this revealing biography that will shock and surprise both Anna's fans and detractors alike. Based on scores of interviews, Front Row unveils the Anna Wintour even those closest to her don't know. Oppenheimer chronicles this insecure and creative powerhouse's climb to the top of the bitchy, competitive fashion magazine world, showing up close, as never before exposed, how she artfully crafted and reinvented herself along the way. <br><br>She's been called many things-"Nuclear Wintour," by the British press, "cold suspicious and autocratic, a vision in skinniness," by Grace Mirabella, the editor she dethroned at <i>Vogue</i>, and the "Devil" by those who believe she's the inspiration for a recent bestselling novel written by a former assistant.<br><br>Included among the startling revelations in <i>Front Row</i> are:<br> * Anna's "silver spoon" childhood spent craving time with her father.<br> * Anna's rebellious teen years in London, obsessed with fashion, night-clubbing and dating roguish men.<br> * Anna's many tempestuous romances.<br> * Anna's curious marriage to a brilliant child psychiatrist, her role as a mother, and the shocking scandal that led to divorce when she had an affair with a married man.<br></p><p>Jerry Oppenheimer is an investigative reporter and TV news and documentary producer. He has been writing definitive, bestselling biographies of American icons since the mid-80s, including Rock Hudson, Barbara Walters, Ethel Kennedy, Martha Stewart, the Clintons and Jerry Seinfeld.<br>The editor in chief of a pop-culture magazine where I used to work would sternly forbid the staff to use the word "icon," unless they were referring to ancient Russian religious art. And I applauded him! The English language is eroding fast, and we need to throw up all possible embankments.<p>Yet when one reads Jerry Oppenheimer's gleefully ballyhooed biography of another editor in chief -- or "editrix," a sexist term Anna Wintour helped inspire -- icon is exactly the word that comes to mind. Not in the sense of "legend" or "very big celebrity," as it is breathlessly applied to people like Madonna (though in the fashion industry at least, Wintour has certainly achieved such stature), but "icon" meaning image, portrait, cartoon. Many ex-friends, lovers and business associates sallied forth to speak about Wintour -- now 55, a woman in her prime like Miss Jean Brodie, presiding over the cr�me de la cr�me or rather the skim milk of skim milk of the Cond� Nast finishing school. (Disclosure: I am a contributing editor at Allure, a Cond� Nast publication.) But most of her current intimates refused to speak for the record, and in the absence of such testimony, the author often is forced to construct his aloof, elusive subject as a collection of visual symbols. Wintour is her miniskirt; her bobbed hair (it gets a five-page disquisition); her bloody-rare hamburger; her ubiquitous sunglasses -- which, we learn in one of the book's few sympathetic moments, are not a style affectation, but a cover up; the poor thing is apparently "blind as a bat." Could it be that Vogue's top vixen has some personality traits in common with another "icon" of this season, the half-deaf aviator-mogul Howard Hughes, immortalized in the Oscar-nominated movie "The Aviator"?</p><p>As in Hughes's case, it's hard to feel much sympathy for Wintour, who was born into privilege and has refused to relinquish it for a nanosecond. (When her East Village sublet was overrun by cockroaches in 1978, Oppenheimer reports, she fled in a taxi, never to return.) Her mother was a bespectacled Bostonian social worker who never got over the accidental death of her eldest son, and whose rural American relatives are treated like hired help by adult Anna (or so they complain); her father was the renowned London newspaper editor Charles "Chilly Charlie" Wintour, a bit of a Black Jack Bouvier type who later remarried one Audrey Slaughter. (One of the many pleasures of the Wintours' tale is how densely populated it is with outlandishly named, British bodice-ripper-sounding characters: Drusillas and Isabellas and Georginas. Nearly everybody is quoted in swooping italics, which enhances the effect.)</p><p>After his daughter scorned traditional schooling -- the mean teachers weren't thrilled about that penchant for miniskirts -- Daddy Wintour helped her get a couple of career breaks, beginning with a stint as a shopgirl at Biba, the boutique of London's swinging '60s. You might need to be a serious media or fashion wonk to appreciate Oppenheimer's meticulous tracing of the single-minded career arc that followed, the most titillating revelation of which might be that Wintour put in time at a now defunct sister magazine to Penthouse -- a fact she later deftly excised from her r�sum�. Amid the hirings and firings and photo shoots, we find a newsflash: The Vogue editor can be demanding in the workplace! To achieve her current perch, it appears, she harnessed "unvarnished ambition" -- still, incredibly, a slur when applied to women. The overall impression is almost as cartoonish as that sketched in The Devil Wears Prada, a roman � clef by Wintour's former assistant Lauren Weisberger.</p><p>If only for its verisimilitude, Front Row is an infinitely more satisfying Wintour treatise than that limply plotted bestseller; if Weisberger's heroine had taken a week off to groove at a Bob Marley concert, no one would've believed it. But the text could have used a little judicious airbrushing. Oppenheimer is fond of slipping jarringly into hipster colloquialisms like "way cool" and "freaking" -- more suitable to a contributor to Vogue's extremely successful teen spinoff edition than to a veteran biographer. He fails to acknowledge that even if you hate what Vogue represents, in its current incarnation it's a very, very good magazine; delicious in its unapologetic elitism and strong if fantastical point of view, a pleasure to page through every month. And he attributes the phrase "give them what they never knew they needed" to Wintour's predecessor, Grace Mirabella, without crediting the inspiration of Mirabella's predecessor, the flamingly iconic Diana Vreeland. </p><p>Reviewed by Alexandra Jacobs <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

That proved to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of writing this book--the characters are all so likable (well,&nbsp;<i>almost</i>&nbsp;all of them). It was a pleasure to be able to live in their world--1913 London--for the three years that I researched and wrote this book.

He was extravagant, grandiose, enthusiastic, erratic, and an unrelenting proponent of expanding consciousness and challenging authority. His experiments with psilocybin and LSD at Harvard University and Millbrook, New York, were instrumental in propelling the nation into the psychedelic era of the 1960s. From the 1980s until his death in 1996 he fully embraced the possibilities of freedom offered by the developments in computer technology and the instant communication made possible by the Internet. <br> <br>The essence of Leary's life has often been reduced to the celebrated formula of "Turn On, Tune In, and Drop Out." The wider implications of this esoteric call to communion have been lost, just as the multifaceted nature of Leary's personality was obscured by the superficial spin put on his life and ideas. In this book a wide array of individuals from all stages of Leary's life, friends and foes alike, provide a more complete view of the man and his impact on American culture. <br> <br>It is still too early to know how posterity will judge the man and his ideas, but <i>Timothy Leary: Outside Looking In</i> shows that Leary was often so far ahead of his time that few could follow the extensive range of his thought.</p><p>Robert Forte studied the history and psychology of religion at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago and has taught at the University of California in Santa Cruz.

His die-hard fascination with the human brain was not all about altering it, but about using it to its fullest.&#x201d; <br>--Winona Ryder <br> <br>Timothy Leary inspired strong feelings in everyone he came into contact with during his momentous life. An unrelenting proponent of expanding consciousness and challenging authority, he was brilliant and erratic, extravagant and enthusiastic, wise and foolish. Ram Dass called him the most creative man he had ever known, while Richard Nixon called him the most dangerous man in the world. Many agree that his exuberant popularizing of psychedelics radically altered the course of the twentieth century. His research at Harvard University and subsequent dismissal from the faculty helped to inaugurate the counterculture of the 1960s, awakening a generation to its own potential. His later arrests, escapes from prison, asylum in Switzerland, and return to the United States mark him as an archetypal hero. His eventual embracing of computers and the Internet kept him at the forefront of the battle for personal freedom and creative expression. <br> <br>The essence of Leary&#x2019;s life has often been reduced to his celebrated formula &#x201c;Turn on, tune in, and drop out.&#x201d; But the wider implications of this call to communion are forgotten, just as the complex nature of Leary&#x2019;s personality is often reduced to the superficial spin put on his ideas by the media. In <em>Timothy Leary: Outside Looking In</em>, many of the great artists, thinkers, and rebels of our time discuss Leary&#x2019;s life and legacy. In doing so, this gathering of minds goes beyond a simple tribute to the man and becomes a provocative dialogue on the evolution of consciousness. <br> <br>ROBERT FORTE studied the history and psychology of religion at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago and has taught at the University of California in Santa Cruz.

With this book, Merton's art at last moves out of the shadows to be appreciated for what it is: a revealing expression of his state of mind and heart in the 1960s, and a visual correlative to his mature works of spiritual writing such as <i>New Seeds of Contemplation</i> and <i>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</i>. Roger Lipsey provides a fascinating analysis of the simple and striking images and their significance in Merton's journey. He find in them resonances with Asian calligraphy and American abstract expressionism, and relates them to the influence of Merton's wide circle of friends, which included such diverse figures as the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, the poet Czeslaw Milosz, the Zen scholar D. T. Suzuki, and the artist Ad Reinhardt&#x2014;among many others. <br><br>But the centerpiece of the book is the art itself, presented in a portfolio of thirty-four representative pieces that reflect the changing themes and methods of Merton's work. Each is accompanied by selections from his writings from the 1960s that reflect the inward and outward territories Merton was exploring in the period when these remarkable images were created.</p><p>Roger Lipsey is a biographer, art historian, editor, and translator. He is the author of <i>An Art of Our Own: The Spiritual in Twentieth-Century Art;</i> <i>Angelic Mistakes: The Art of Thomas Merton;</i> and most recently&nbsp;<i>Hammarskj�ld: A Life</i>,&nbsp;hailed as the definitive Dag Hammarskj�ld biography.<b>Winner of the 2007 Thomas Merton Award from the International Thomas Merton Society</b><br>"Lipsey is a fine messenger for Merton. There are few books that so readably and thoroughly admire the practice of any artist as beautifully as Lipsey's does. Lipsey is a master of interpretation, guiding more than leading headstrong, nudging the reader to join with him and with Merton in the act of creating, and then in understanding the consequence of that creation. Lipsey's quietly argued book creates a strong context for continued appreciation of this giant light from the last century&#x2014;a light that shines, we see, through still more lenses than we previously knew."&#x2014;<i>Parabola</i><br>"Roger Lipsey has custom-built the very place, perhaps, that Merton dreamed of finding for his work; an authentic refuge for luminous things and curious treasures."&#x2014;Suzi Gablik, author of <i>The Reenchantment of Art</i> <br><br>"Kudos to Roger Lipsey for opening up Thomas Merton's visual art, which has been largely ignored until now by his reading public as well as by most Merton scholars and interpreters of his work. Our gratitude for <i>Angelic Mistakes</i> is boundless, both to the author and publisher. This richly illustrated volume is the best introduction to the mature visual world of Thomas Merton, which deserves a wide audience."&#x2014;Brother Patrick Hart, Thomas Merton's secretary, editor of <i>The Intimate Merton</i> <p>"It's not easy to write about the deeply wordless world from which these haunting images emerged, but at last the challenge to think out loud about this neglected side of Merton has been taken up by Roger Lipsey. Breaking new ground, Lipsey thoughtfully explores aspects of Merton-as-artist."&#x2014;Jim Forest, author of <i>Living with Wisdom: A Life of Thomas Merton</i><br>&nbsp;"This astonishing book looks at an aspect of Merton's life that has been almost ignored&#x2014;his art&#x2014;and shows, with copious quotations and profound insight, that it was a visual expression of his prayer. Here we have access to that wordless, imageless experience that was nearer to him than life itself. It is a book to be read slowly, quietly, and repeatedly: a wonderful book."&#x2014;Sister Wendy Beckett, host of the PBS series <i>Sister Wendy's American Collection</i> <br><br>"A remarkable piece of work and a remarkable piece of publishing."&#x2014;Phyllis Tickle, author of <i>Prayer Is a Place: America's Religious Landscape Observed</i></p></p><h2>Dutch Uncle</h2><p>Despite his determination to stay straight, ex-con Harry Healy is desperate for money and agrees to make one simple delivery for drug dealer Manfred Pfiser, only to find himself caught in the middle of a deadly robbery scheme involving a former cellmate, an aging high-school baseball star, a murderous sociopath, and a beautiful beach bunny. Original.</p><p><b>Peter Pavia</b>'s&nbsp;work has appeared in many publications, including <i>The New York Times</i>. In addition to <i>Dutch Uncle</i>, he is the author of <i>The Cuba Project</i>, and co-author, with Legs McNeil and Jennifer Osborne, of <i>The Other Hollywood: An Oral History of the Adult Film Industry</i>. He has been a faculty member of The New School&#x2019;s Writing Program since 2001.&nbsp;This crime chuckler wears its Elmore Leonard influence on its cover: "Dutch" is Leonard's nickname. The Dutch uncle in the book is an actual Dutchman whose cocaine and untimely demise set a small swarm of crooks and cops in motion. Harry Healy is the sort-of hero, a likable, small-time criminal, just out of jail, who has a hard time making good decisions. But he's just one player in a memorably quirky cast that includes a dim ex-jock snorting his way through his inheritance; a ditzy babe whose constant nakedness is annoying everyone; a short, chunky detective who struggles with his sensitivity training; and the braces-wearing Latina colleague he might just be made for. Pavia, coauthor of <i>The Other Hollywood</i> [BKL F 1 05], an "oral history" of the porn industry, redraws the hard-boiled boundaries of the Hard Case Crime line a bit to include this offbeat diversion in the style of Leonard, Carl Hiaasen, and Charles Willeford's Hoke Moseley books.

Twelve of those have been #1 national bestsellers.&nbsp;The Price of Politics PROLOGUE<p></p> <br>The lavish dinner at the Capital Hilton Hotel in downtown Washington on the evening of Saturday, March 11, 2006, was about the last place you would expect to find him. But there was Barack Obama, age 44, the junior senator from Illinois for only the last 14 months, in formal white-tie with tails and very much at ease in the crowd of 600. His trademark smile, broad and infectious, dominated his face as I met him for the first time.<br> <br>We were at the annual Gridiron Club dinner&#x2014;a rite of passage for national political figures such as Obama. The crowd included President George W. Bush and most of the major politicians in Washington. It was one of Senator Obama&#x2019;s maiden voyages into the unsavory belly of the Washington beast. Bush was to speak for the Republicans, and Obama had been selected to speak for the Democrats.<br> <br>Founded in 1885, the Gridiron&#x2014;named because its motto was to &#x201c;singe but not burn&#x201d;&#x2014;had the reputation of being an old-school event of in-jokes, skits and music that seemed more fitted to a bygone era.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re from Wheaton, Illinois,&#x201d; Obama said to me, referring, unprompted, to the small town where I was raised in the late 1940s and &#x2019;50s. Wheaton, 25 miles west of Chicago, is home to Wheaton College, best known for its alumnus evangelist Billy Graham, whose influence permeated the town.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you didn&#x2019;t carry Wheaton,&#x201d; I said confidently, referring to his Senate race 16 months earlier. A bastion of Midwestern conservatism and country-club Republicans, Wheaton was the most Republican town in the country in the 1950s, or at least regarded itself that way.<br> <br>&#x201c;I carried DuPage County by 60 percent!&#x201d; Obama responded, beaming that incandescent smile. Wheaton is the county seat of DuPage.<br> <br>I said that seemed utterly impossible. That couldn&#x2019;t be the Wheaton or DuPage I had known.<br> <br>Obama continued to smile me down. The certainty on his face was deep, giving me pause. Suddenly, I remembered that Obama&#x2019;s opponent for the Senate seat had been Alan Keyes, the conservative black Republican gadfly. Keyes had substituted at the last minute for the first Republican nominee, who withdrew from the race when divorce and child custody records revealed that he had taken his wife to sex clubs in New York, New Orleans and Paris.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, everyone who runs for office should have Alan Keyes as their opponent,&#x201d; I said, trying to hold my ground.<br> <br>Obama smiled some more&#x2014;almost mirthful, yet unrevealing. The conversation turned to Illinois politics, and Obama ticked off the areas where he had strong support&#x2014;Chicago, the labor unions&#x2014;and weak support, downstate and the farm areas. He defined the categories skillfully, expanding on the state&#x2019;s interest groups and voting blocs. He made it clear he knew where he had work to do.<br> <br>He sounded like a graceful old-fashioned pol. Though he had carried DuPage by 60 percent, he had won 70 percent of the statewide vote.<br> <br>His wife, Michelle, stood by his side in a stunning gown. But the focus and the questions from people crowded around were all directed at the dazzling new star.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>When he appeared at the podium several hours later, Obama stood perfectly erect, projecting radiant confidence.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is a true story,&#x201d; he said.1 &#x201c;A friend sent me a clip about a new study by a psychologist at the University of Scotland who says sex before a public speaking engagement actually enhances your oratorical power. I showed this clip to Michelle, before we arrived here tonight. She looked it over, handed it back and said, &#x2018;Do the best you can!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>The laughter ignited instantly.<br> <br>&#x201c;This appearance is really the capstone of an incredible 18 months,&#x201d; he said, citing the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, cover of Newsweek, a best-selling autobiography, Dreams from My Father, a Grammy award for reading the audiobook. &#x201c;Really what else is there to do? Well, I guess&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could pass a law or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>The self-deprecation played well.<br> <br>Referring to Senator John McCain&#x2019;s positive treatment by the press up to that point, Obama said, &#x201c;Some of my colleagues call John a prima donna. Me? I call him a role model. Think of it as affirmative action. Why should the white guys be the only ones who are overhyped?&#x201d;<br> <br>The self-awareness played smooth.<br> <br>Noting the speculation that the 2008 presidential campaign could come down to McCain, a maverick Republican, versus Senator Hillary Clinton, he said, &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t realize how much John and Hillary have in common. They&#x2019;re both very smart. Both very hardworking. And they&#x2019;re both hated by the Republicans!&#x201d;<br> <br>This played bipartisan.<br> <br>Obama turned toward President Bush, who was on the stage nearby. &#x201c;The president was so excited about Tom Friedman&#x2019;s book The World Is Flat. As soon as he saw the title, he said, &#x2018;You see, I was right!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>The joke played confident.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to thank you for all the generous advance coverage you&#x2019;ve given me in anticipation of a successful career. When I actually do something, we&#x2019;ll let you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The audience clapped and hooted in delight.<br> <br>After dinner the buzz was like a chain reaction. Not only could this young Obama tell a joke on himself, with the required self-effacement, but he had remarkable communications skills. An editor at The Washington Post once said that journalists only write two stories: Oh, the horror of it all, and Oh, the wonder of it all. Obama was the wonder of it all that night and he basked in the attention he had captured. Rarely have I seen anyone manage the moment so well. He had frankly and forthrightly trumpeted his lack of accomplishment, and the roomful of egos ate it up. But if he had done nothing much so far, why was he there? Why the buzz? The approbation? What exactly was being measured?<br> <br>It was the dramatic impact he was having on his audience. The triumph was the effect.<br> <br>Twenty-five years earlier in 1981, I had attended a Gridiron dinner where the speaker for the Democrats was Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the bookish intellectual who had served in prominent posts in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Moynihan, then 53, made some good jokes, but his theme was serious: what it means to be a Democrat. The soul of the party was to fight for equality and the little guy, he said. The party cared for the underdogs in America, the voiceless, powerless and those who got stepped on. It was a defining speech, and the buzz afterward was that Moynihan was going to be president. He wasn&#x2019;t, of course. That was then, this was now.<br> <br>Obama had not once mentioned the party or high purpose. His speech, instead, was about Obama, his inexperience, and, in the full paradox of the moment, what he had not done.<br> <br>Two and a half years later, he was president-elect of the United States.</p><h2>Vibrations and waves (The M.I.T. introductory physics series)</h2><p><p>The M.I.T. Introductory Physics Series is the result of a program of careful study, planning, and development that began in 1960. The Education Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (formerly the Science Teaching Center) was established to study the process of instruction, aids thereto, and the learning process itself, with special reference to science teaching at the university level. Generous support from a number of foundations provided the means for assembling and maintaining an experienced staff to co-operate with members of the Institute's Physics Department in the examination, improvement, and development of physics curriculum materials for students planning careers in the sciences. After careful analysis of objectives and the problems involved, preliminary versions of textbooks were prepared, tested through classroom use at M.I.T. and other institutions, re-evaluated, rewritten, and tried again. Only then were the final manuscripts undertaken.</p></p><p></p><h2>Main currents of Marxism: Its rise, growth, and dissolution</h2><p><b>The commanding study of Marxism, now in one masterful volume with a new preface and epilogue by the author.</b><br><br>From philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, one of the giants of twentieth-century intellectual history, comes this highly influential study of Marxism. Written in exile, this "prophetic work" presents, according to the Library of Congress, "the most lucid and comprehensive history of the origins, structure, and posthumous development of the system of thought that had the greatest impact on the twentieth century." Kolakowski traces the intellectual foundations of Marxist thought from Plotonius through Lenin, Lukacs, Sartre, and Mao. He reveals Marxism to be "the greatest fantasy of our century...an idea that began in Promethean humanism and culminated in the monstrous tyranny of Stalinism." In a brilliant coda, he examines the collapse of international Communism in light of the last tumultuous decades. <i>Main Currents of Marxism</i> remains <i>the</i> indispensable book in its field.</p><p>The Polish-born Leszek Kolakowski was the first recipient of the million-dollar John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences. He lives in Oxford.Text: English, Polish (translation)</p><h2>Them: A Memoir of Parents</h2><p>The biographer author of Simone Weil and Soviet Women presents a portrait of her famous parents, describing their respective roles as a gifted artist and a sophisticated fashion icon, their flight from World War II Paris, their rise within New York society, and their relationships with famous and powerful people.</p><p>Francine du Plessix Gray is a regular contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and the author of numerous essays and books, including <i>Simone Weil, At Home with the Marquis de Sade: A Life, Rage and Fire, Lovers and Tyrants</i>, and <i>Soviet Women</i>. She lives with her husband, the painter Cleve Gray.The story that Francine du Plessix Gray tells in this exceedingly long family history cum biography cum memoir is exceedingly interesting, indeed at times startlingly so. The author's mother, father and stepfather were remarkable people who came from equally remarkable families that were involved in 20th-century European and American history and culture in important, sometimes intimate ways. Add to this Gray herself (a well-regarded novelist, biographer and journalist) and her late husband, Cleve Gray (an important Abstract Expressionist painter), and you have all the ingredients for a high-octane book, one filled with the names of notable and consequential people, one that will send many readers to the index before they turn to the introduction. <p>Gray's mother, Tatiana Yakovleva, was a member of the czarist Russian aristocracy who survived near-starvation after the Revolution, escaped to France, and in turn escaped to the United States about two steps ahead of the Nazis. Along the way she fell in love with the highly charismatic poet Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky, and he with her, and though their love was never consummated, Tatiana became the inspiration for some of his most important poems and thus a significant if peripheral figure in contemporary Russian literature. Upon decamping to New York, she made her way to the fashionable women's store Henri Bendel, and then to Saks Fifth Avenue, at both of which she became one of the world's most famous designers of women's hats. "Nothing goes to a woman's head like a hat by our own Tatiana," Saks declared in the mid-1950s. "Her magnificent creations are the delight of our most particular customers." </p><p>Gray's father, Vicomte Bertrand du Plessix, came from a noble but fallen family, one "wrecked by generations of poverty and pride." Like "my mother dreaming of glory in her own dismal Russian province, he had longed for the brio and glamour of the siren Paris." His career was in the social sciences, but he was also "an accomplished musician; a passionate lover of poetry; a licensed pilot; an expert in Chinese sculpture, Pompeian glass and many other branches of the visual arts." He was a skilled driver and aviator, a "loyal patriot of the world's most anarchic people," an "idealist and a fighter through and through." In the summer of 1940, flying over the Mediterranean en route to join Charles de Gaulle's Free French movement, his plane was "shot down by fascist artillery," and he was killed. He "became one of the first four Frenchmen to be honored with the Croix de la Lib�ration, de Gaulle's highest award." </p><p>As for Gray's stepfather, he was Alexander Liberman. "Born in Russia, like my mother, and educated in Great Britain and in France," he "emanated an aura of steely self-discipline." When he and Tatiana fled to New York in 1940 (they did not marry until 1942), he maneuvered his way into the offices of Cond� Nast, the publisher of glossy, fashionable magazines, and quickly engineered his way up the ladder, first in the art department of Vogue (before long he was its art director), then in the larger universe of Cond� Nast itself, ultimately becoming "editorial director of the entire Cond� Nast publishing empire," rising to a salary of a million dollars a year. He had an all-embracing "sense of self-importance, and the accompanying delusions of grandeur," and as he rose ever higher his army of enemies grew ever larger. He had a "byzantine talent for self-promotion," and beneath his "suave, urbane" exterior lay a calculating social and professional climber. He was unfailingly gallant to his stepdaughter, hence the love she maintains for him despite all reasons to feel otherwise. In the tiny but disproportionately visible world of fashion journalism, he was immensely influential, loved, admired, envied and hated in more or less equal measure. </p><p>That brief summary only hints at the richness of all three of these lives, not to mention the innumerable other lives to which they were connected or from which they were descended. To mention just one: Tatiana's Uncle Sasha, Alexandre Iacovleff, who in his niece's "inevitably romanticized accounts . . . was a superman who had traveled to the most dangerous places on earth, wrestled with wild beasts in distant deserts, explored caves never before entered by any man." In Sasha's case, the truth does not seem to have fallen far short of the fanciful. He was "a prodigious linguist, an eloquent writer, an exceptionally gifted athlete, and an excellent cook; he designed furniture, was skilled at bookbinding and lacquering techniques, and created theater sets and costumes." In Paris in the late 1920s, by which time Tatiana was a "beautiful teenager," Sasha "set to work healing his niece's insecurities and refining his 'gorgeous savage,' as he called her, into a work of art." How he did so gives some flavor of the life lived by these extraordinarily cultured, sophisticated White Russian �migr�s, in Paris and elsewhere: </p><p>"Although he was terrified that his beautiful niece might become a courtesan, Sasha relaxed his mother's chaperoning rules, allowing her to go out in the evenings with a few young men he judged suitable. He also perfected his niece's table manners; dragged her to museums to instruct her in the history of art; took her to Gordes, Carcassonne, Chartres, Mont-St.-Michel to give her a sense of European history and architecture; made her read Stendhal, Balzac, Baudelaire, and other French classics; brought her to friends' couture houses to buy whatever modestly priced models' samples were left in the racks; advised her on how to hold her own at dinner-party conversations." </p><p>For the rest of her life, Tatiana, "while bemoaning Uncle Sasha's excessive passion for adventure and risk, . . . remained awed by his courage and his stoicism, elaborated on his prodigal generosity, kindness and elegance. . . . He has remained our family's most romantic and legendary figure, its principal model of valor and stoicism. He took risks that most of us would never have dared to take on; he lived adventure for us." An Uncle Sasha is given to precious few families, yet in the three families that combined to produce and rear Francine du Plessix Gray, larger-than-life men and women, some like Sasha of genuinely heroic proportions, abound. </p><p>Only a few pages into Them: A Memoir of Parents, today's American reader becomes acutely aware of two other aspects of all these people's lives, the author's included. One is the White Russian character and heritage, involving intense longing for a lost Russia -- for more of the same, expressed far more eloquently, read Vladimir Nabokov's incomparable memoir, Speak, Memory, with its rueful thoughts "of all I had missed in my country, of the things I would not have omitted to note and treasure, had I suspected before that my life was to veer in such a violent way" -- and the society that once existed there. Some of this is nostalgia for aristocracy, privilege and the servile peasantry, but there is also a longing for a world of culture, erudition, sophistication, cosmopolitanism. </p><p>That last word points to the second important aspect of these people's lives: They were, and are, citizens not of a particular nation but of the world. The center of the world for many of them for many years has been New York, where the White Russian presence in publishing and the arts has been formidable, but they are at home in many great cities elsewhere -- Paris and London most especially -- and they are fluent in three, four, five or more languages. They put us provincial Americans to shame, with our indifference to other languages and other cultures, our smug assumption that we don't have to talk to the world on its terms because it will talk to us on ours. Though reading Them gave me much pleasure, it also left me with no small sense of shame at my own complicity in this inexcusable provincialism. </p><p>Pleasurable though the book indeed is, I have reservations about it on two counts. The first is its sheer length. Had it been tightened by at least a hundred pages, it would be a better book. It is too repetitious. To cite two relatively trivial examples, as quoted above, Uncle Sasha's "stoicism" is cited twice in one paragraph, and we are told twice, albeit not in precisely the same words, that "food retains a lifelong importance for survivors of famines." The preliminary material about the backgrounds of the author's three families occupies nearly one-half of the book, leaving the reader to wait 230 pages before the book's real business -- Tatiana and Alexander in New York -- gets under way. That could have been trimmed of numerous bits and pieces of mildly interesting but essentially extraneous detail, which would have heightened, rather than diminished, the book's overall effect. </p><p>A second difficulty is that though Gray chides her mother for her "innate narcissism," she displays more than a bit of the same herself. Toward the book's end she describes her mother's reaction to a passage in her novel Lovers and Tyrants that was transparently -- and, for Tatiana, painfully -- autobiographical. "How could you?" Tatiana asked her daughter. "Tell the truth this way?" Gray says that she "gently" replied, "I needed to tell it in order to heal myself." It is difficult to imagine a more self-centered motive for writing -- the novel as self-administered therapy, no matter the pain caused to others -- and one senses too much of the same at work in Them, particularly in the last hundred or so pages, when what is described as A Memoir of Parents becomes, in effect, the author's memoir of herself. Writing a memoir/biography of one's parents is a difficult task, for some element of first-person narrative is inescapable, but toward the end, Francine du Plessix Gray gives us more than is necessary of herself, diverting the spotlight away from the two people on whom it rightly belongs. </p><p></p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

She is also the author of <i>Beauty,</i> a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. She lives in England.</p>In Her Own Words... <p>"I was an only child and my father was in the Navy. We moved every year or two&#x2014;California, Japan, upstate New York, New England. I early found the world of books much more satisfactory than the unstable so-called real world. I can&#x2019;t remember the first time I read Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x2019;s but this particular story, about a little girl all alone in a strange land who told stories so wonderful that she believed them herself, fasci-nated me. I never quite lived up to Sara Crewe&#x2019;s standard, but I tried awfully hard.</p><p>"Writing has always been the other side of reading for me; it never occurred to me not to make up stories. Once I got old enough to realize that authorship existed as a thing one might aspire to, I knew it was for me. I even majored in English literature in college, a good indication of my fine bold disdain for anything so trivial as earning a living; I was going to be a writer, like Dickens and Hardy and George Eliot. And Kipling and H. Rider Haggard and J.R.R. Tolkien. I was, however, going to tell breathtaking stories about girls who had adventures. I was tired of the boys always getting the best parts in the best books. What with reading and making up my own stories, I spent most of my life in my head; about the only irresistible attraction reality had for me was in the shape of horses and riding. And I liked traveling. Perhaps because of my childhood, staying in one place for very long just seemed to me like a waste of opportunity.</p><p>"It&#x2019;s funny, though, the things life does to you. Inadvertently I discovered myself settling down, looking for excuses not to climb on another airplane. I bought a house because I fell in love with it, and it was somewhere to leave the thousands of books I picked up everywhere I went. Later, I decided that I wanted something around that didn&#x2019;t necessarily sit politely on a shelf till I took it down, so I bought a dog, a whippet I named Rowan. Insidiously I began liking it that tomorrow was going to be much like yesterday: walking the dog, sitting at the typewriter. I declared myself to have found home in my tiny house in a small village two-thirds of the way up the coast of Maine. I also, a little ruefully, concluded that my individual mix of the writer&#x2019;s traditional absent-mindedness, a rather uncompromising feminism, and a naturally intransigent personality made marriage or any sort of permanent romantic attachment impractical. I didn&#x2019;t actually think I was missing much; I liked being single. </p><p>"This no doubt explains&#x2014;somehow&#x2014;why I am now living in a small village in a very large house in Hampshire, England, with my husband, the English writer Peter Dickinson, three whippets, and a horse, and what seems to me, the only child and ex-solitary adult, about half a million Dickinson grandchildren rioting underfoot, down the corridors, and across the garden. When Peter and I decided to get married, it was obvious to me I was the one who had to emigrate; I was the military brat with lifelong experience of pulling up and moving on. So I dug up my tender new under-standing of "home," packed it very carefully, and brought it over here with me, with the eighty cartons of books and one bewildered whippet. It has taken root vigorously here, but the message to headquarters is very emphatic: "Don&#x2019;t you ever do this to us again." I&#x2019;m not likely to: I&#x2019;ve planted over four hundred rosebushes in what were once Peter&#x2019;s classic English garden borders&#x2014;and look after them devotedly. I have the scars to prove it. I think I&#x2019;ve discovered reality after all. I&#x2019;m astonished at how interesting it is. It&#x2019;s giving me more things to write stories about."</p>"Robin McKinley knows her geography of fantasy, the nuances of the language, the atmosphere of magic . . ."<br><br>Robin McKinley knows her geography of fantasy, the nuances of the language, the atmosphere of magic. . .

Arranged chronologically, the documents are also keyed so as to be accessible to readers interested in specific topics such as urban life, the politics of the royal courts, interfaith relations, or women, marriage, and the family.</p><p>For some historians, medieval Iberian society was primarily one of peaceful coexistence and cross-cultural fertilization; others have sketched a harsher picture of Muslims and Christians engaged in an ongoing contest for political, religious, and economic advantage culminating in the fall of Muslim Granada and the expulsion of the Jews in the late fifteenth century. The reality that emerges in <i>Medieval Iberia</i> is more nuanced than either of these scenarios can comprehend; this monumental collection offers unparalleled access to the multicultural complexity of the lands that would become modern Portugal and Spain.</p></p><p>Olivia Remie Constable is Associate Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame and author of Trade and Traders in Muslim Spain: The Commercial Realignment of the Iberian Peninsula, 900-1500.<p>"The editor is to be warmly congratulated for having gathered together an impressive collection of sources which should prove of great interest to specialist and nonspecialist alike."&#x2014;<i>English Historical Review</i></p><br><br><p>"With the assistance of a large team of acknowledged experts, Constable has succeeded in assembling a distinguished miscellany of unusual interest which deserves to be warmly and widely welcomed."&#x2014;<i>History Today</i></p></p><h2>The Long Surrender</h2><p>Chronicles the collapse of the Confederacy and the flight of Jefferson Davis and his cabinet in an effort to escape capture and surrender</p><p>8 1.5-hour cassetteshistory of the collapse of the Confederacy.</p><h2>Vegan Holiday Kitchen: More than 200 Delicious, Festive Recipes for Special Occasions</h2><p>Have yourself a happy vegan holiday!

The Church now says "Yes!"<br><br> Zelie Martin and her husband, Louis, were declared Venerable by the Church in 1994 for their heroic virtue, and the couple's cause is now complete, ending with their cannonization in 2015. Zelie married at 27, bore 9 children, ran a home business and did a superb job of raising 5 daughters, including "the greatest saint of modern times" (St. Pius X). She died of breast cancer at 45, but her greatness was recognized by her family and friends, and is now known to the world.<br><br> Zelie suffered many of the ordinary burdens of life, yet she was happy, loved her children madly and enjoyed them immensely.

Pichon, her spiritual director, afterwards authorized her desire for a vow of virginity, and she became a Carmelite nun in 1894. She was instrumental in spreading her sister's message by various means, but also found time to write two books of her own: <i>The Mother of the Little Flower</i> and <i>The Father of the Little Flower</i>. Four years after celebrating her Diamond Jubilee, Sister Celine Martin died on February 25, 1959.</p><h2>Calico Spy (Volume 3) (Undercover Ladies)</h2><p>Pinkerton operative Katie Madison&#x2019;s newest case takes her to Calico, Kansas, where two Harvey House restaurant waitresses were murdered in mysterious circumstances.

The museum lives up to its nouveau reputation, having a collection without focus, a curator with grandiose plans and some Moresby family members with personal agendas sniping at the budget. Jonathan and amiable but dodgy art dealer Hector di Souza are invited to a party to celebrate Moresby's commitment to the Big Museum, otherwise known as "the BM." As the acquisition of a lost Bernini bust of Pope Pius V is announced, di Souza is visibly distressed; moments later Moresby is dead and di Souza and the bust have disappeared. Jonathan calls his old love in Rome, Flavia de Stefano of the Italian National Art Theft Fund, to report on the smuggled and now missing bust and moments later just escapes being killed. Flavia, connecting the bust to an old war story involving some of the suspects, flies to L.A. and, joined by an Italian LAPD cop, tries to get Jonathan out of trouble, the killer in jail and the bust back to Roma. With sharply etched characters and art world lore, Pears's latest tale is a lark in grand British style. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Modern Military Aircraft: The World&#39;s Fighting Aircraft: 1945 to Present Day</h2><p>Modern Military Aircraft is a comprehensive guide to the world&#x2019;s fighting aircraft since World War II, from the earliest jet fighters and basic piston-engined bombers, to today&#x2019;s high-tech and stealthy superfighters.

The Holocaust, in particular, because of the scope of its ruthlessness, has raised the question for modern man: "What kind of God allows the horrible and systematic murder of so many innocent people?"<p></p> <p>Quoting widely from Christian, Jewish and secular sources, Regis Martin makes an unflinching examination of this universal question on the meaning of suffering. By meditating on Christ's passion, death and descent into Hell, he asks us to consider anew the God who overcomes evil by plunging himself into the depths of human misery.</p> <p>The author presents the arguments of those who say that because of the Holocaust, and other such numerous horrors in history, all human discourse is suspended, including that which presumes the existence of a good and all-powerful God. He responds with a penetrating discussion of the deeper meaning of Christ's life, passion, death and resurrection in relation to human suffering, and then uses the examples of modern martyrs of the Holocaust such as Edith Stein and Maximilian Kolbe to show the meaning of the sacrifice of their lives and so many others in the larger context of Christ's self-emptying for the sake of others</p></p><p></p><h2>Atomic Tragedy: Henry L. Stimson and the Decision to Use the Bomb against Japan</h2><p><p>Atomic Tragedy offers a unique perspective on one of the most important events of the twentieth century. As secretary of war during World War II, Henry L. Stimson (1867&#x2013;1950) oversaw the American nuclear weapons program. In a book about how an experienced, principled man faltered when confronted by the tremendous challenge posed by the intersection of war, diplomacy, and technology, Sean L. Malloy examines Stimson's struggle to reconcile his responsibility for "the most terrible weapon ever known in human history" with his long-standing convictions about war and morality. </p><p>Ultimately, Stimson's story is one of failure; despite his beliefs, Stimson reluctantly acquiesced in the use of the atomic bomb against heavily populated Japanese cities in August 1945. This is the first biography of Stimson to benefit from extensive use of papers relating to the Manhattan Project; Malloy has also uncovered evidence illustrating the origins of Stimson's commitment to eliminating or refining the conduct of war against civilians, information that makes clear the agony of Stimson's dilemma.</p><p>The ultimate aim of Atomic Tragedy is not only to contribute to a greater historical understanding of the first use of nuclear weapons but also to offer lessons from the decision-making process during the years 1940&#x2013;1945 that are applicable to the current world environment. As the United States mobilizes scientists and engineers to build new and supposedly more "usable" nuclear weapons and as nations in Asia and the Middle East are replicating the feat of the Manhattan Project physicists at Los Alamos, it is more important than ever that policymakers and analysts recognize the chain of failures surrounding the first use of those weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p></p><p>"It is necessary to have this book now, just as we embark on yet another spasm of atomic expansion. <i>Atomic Tragedy</i> is a book to be reckoned with; it tells the reader about all the conflicting pressures on Henry L. Stimson and fits him in perfectly to his times and to ours. No one can come away from this book without a deep appreciation of the real meaning of Stimson's all-too-human struggles."--Lloyd C. Gardner, Charles and Mary Beard Professor of History, Rutgers University <p> "<i>Atomic Tragedy</i> is an incisive analysis replete with sparkling details and shocking, newly discovered photographs of the immediate aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Sean L. Malloy takes the pioneering work of Barton Bernstein and Gar Alperovitz to the next level in a nuanced history that concisely summarizes and ultimately transcends the existing scholarship."--Elizabeth Borgwardt, author of "A New Deal for the World: America's Vision for Human Rights"</p><p>Sean L.

Always as much naturalist as artist, Arnosky begins with a very few basic, concisely stated (but not simplistic) ideas, pointing out that there are ``shorebirds, land birds, and water birds,'' that some can't fly, that ostriches are biggest and hummingbirds smallest, and even describing the wing motions for flying forward, hovering, or gliding. His handsome portraits--memorably clear and vivid--graphically emphasize the birds' most significant features. The ordering is informal but logical (swan, goose, and duck; stork and heron; chicken and turkey seen together). This is not a book that differentiates mallard from Muscovy, adult from juvenile, or even male from female; it's simply an introduction- -and an excellent one.

In the mid-1700s the attentions of both science and poetry sparked a passion for mountains; Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Lord Byron extolled the sublime experiences to be had on high; and by 1924 the death on Mt Everest of an Englishman named George Mallory came to symbolize the heroic ideals of his day. Macfarlane also reflects on fear, risk, and the shattering beauty of ice and snow, the competition and contemplation of the climb, and the strange alternate reality of high altitude, magically enveloping us in the allure of mountains at every level.<b>Robert Macfarlane&nbsp;</b>is the&nbsp;best-selling author of an award-winning trilogy of books about landscape and the human heart:&nbsp;<i>Mountains of the Mind</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Wild Places</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Old Ways</i>.

He loses his job, his cat disappears, and then his wife fails to return from work. His search for his wife (and his cat) introduces him to a bizarre collection of characters, including two psychic sisters, a possibly unbalanced teenager, an old soldier who witnessed the massacres on the Chinese mainland at the beginning of the Second World War, and a very shady politician.<p> Haruki Murakami is a master of subtly disturbing prose. Mundane events throb with menace, while the bizarre is accepted without comment. Meaning always seems to be just out of reach, for the reader as well as for the characters, yet one is drawn inexorably into a mystery that may have no solution. <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> is an extended meditation on themes that appear throughout Murakami's earlier work. The tropes of popular culture, movies, music, detective stories, combine to create a work that explores both the surface and the hidden depths of Japanese society at the end of the 20th century.</p><p> If it were possible to isolate one theme in <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, that theme would be responsibility. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China keep rising to the surface like a repressed memory, and Toru Okada himself is compelled by events to take responsibility for his actions and struggle with his essentially passive nature. If Toru is supposed to be a Japanese Everyman, steeped as he is in Western popular culture and ignorant of the secret history of his own nation, this novel paints a bleak picture. Like the winding up of the titular bird, Murakami slowly twists the gossamer threads of his story into something of considerable weight. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>Japan's most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II. <br>In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria. <br>Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.</p><h2>One Day On Our Blue Planet: In The Rainforest</h2><p>From breakfast to dinner, dusk to dawn, children will love spending the day with this curious young spider monkey.<br><br>The series focused on the way our young animal friends spend a day continues with an adventurous spider monkey exploring the bustling rainforest of South America with his mother by his side.</p><p>Ella Bailey is an illustrator and writer who focuses on creating charming characters and character-based illustrations, particularly for stories and children&#x2019;s books.

She lives in Nottingham.PreS-K&#x2014;This book takes readers through a day in the rainforest by following a young spider monkey. From the top of the canopy to the dense growth underneath, every page is filled with colorful creatures and foliage, all of which are easily spotted against the lighter hued backgrounds. Birds and mammals are the most prevalent, but there are also a few examples of amphibians, insects, reptiles, and fish. Many of these creatures are labelled on the endpapers, giving interested children a chance to find and identify them. Bailey's illustration style is in line with the publisher's aesthetic.

I pretend I am watching shooting stars and meteors," says the nameless girl protagonist of Cutler's (The Song of the Molimo) moving and, sadly, timely story of the healing power of music in wartime. With winter approaching, food scarce and her father off fighting, the high point of the girl's week is Wednesday, when the relief truck arrives and the community gathers. Most days, she sits with the other children under the stairs until their high energy levels send them running through the halls, where they taunt an unsociable musician named Mr. O. As the girl stands outside his apartment, she remembers how her father described the craftsmanship of Mr. O's cello and the command performances of the cellist's youth. When a rocket destroys the relief truck, Mr. O surprises the children by courageously playing music in the middle of the square and lifting their spirits. Couch's (Wild Child, reviewed above) soft-focus watercolors in burnished shades of gold, copper and fiery red have a dreamlike quality that effectively contrast with the unsentimental narration. He mixes realistic scenes of the war-torn landscape with a surreal sense of war's intrusion on this child's life. While more details about the mysterious Mr. O might have made his change of heart more believable, Cutler's focus on turning calamity on its head will likely have an uplifting effect on readers young and old. Ages 5-9. (Sept.) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 1-4-In poetic prose, a young girl describes what it is like to live in a city ravaged by war. Schools are closed, electricity and telephone service is out, and the only consolation is the arrival each Wednesday of the relief truck bringing food and supplies. To pass time, the children play together in the hallways. When they make too much noise, an elderly musician, Mr. O, opens his apartment door and scolds them. No one, not even the adults, talks to Mr. O, who keeps to himself. But the week after the relief truck is bombed, the old man takes his cello into the courtyard and plays for all of the frightened, hungry people. The music is described as something "which feeds us as truly as the supplies brought by the truck did." Later, when the cello is destroyed by more shelling, the little girl wonders, "What will feed us now?" These and a few other didactic statements, jarringly atypical of any child, mar an otherwise lovely story. Couch's watercolor illustrations, however, are absolute perfection. In warm earth tones, the artist has captured both the emotion and the details of civilian life under siege. While the war is not named, readers may infer a reference to the Balkan conflict. In spite of a little excess verbiage, this is an inspiring story.<br><i>Jackie Hechtkopf, University of Maryland, College Park </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Christmas Beginning: A Novel (The Christmas Stories)</h2><p>Whatever the season, a new novel by bestselling author Anne Perry is always a wonderful gift, but her holiday novels are particularly special treats, and A Christmas Beginning is a deeply felt story of passion and redemption.<br><br>Superintendent Runcorn of Scotland Yard is spending Christmas on the wild and beautiful island of Anglesey off the north coast of Wales. On one of his solitary strolls, the lonely bachelor stumbles upon a lifeless body in the village churchyard. The unfortunate victim is quickly identified as Olivia Costain, the local vicar&#x2019;s younger sister. <br><br>In life, Olivia had been a free spirit, full of charm and grace. For Runcorn, she is a haunting reminder of Melisande Ewart, the one woman he&#x2019;s never been able to forget.

But the evidence proves otherwise, and the unpopular work of discovering who among Olivia&#x2019;s friends and neighbors&#x2013;and numerous eligible suitors&#x2013;is a ruthless killer falls to Runcorn. A plebian outsider in the drawing rooms of the snobbish local gentry, Runcorn never dreams that the key that will unlock the secrets of Olivia&#x2019;s life and death may also, miraculously, open the door to a new future for himself.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of four earlier holiday novels&#x2013;A Christmas Journey, A Christmas Visitor, A Christmas Guest, and A Christmas Secret&#x2013;as well as two acclaimed series set in Victorian England&#x2013;the William Monk novels and the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels&#x2013;and five World War I novels. Anne Perry lives in Scotland. Visit her website at www.anneperry.net.So this was the Isle of Anglesey. Runcorn stood on the rugged headland and stared across the narrow water of the Menai Strait towards the mountains of Snowdonia and mainland Wales, and he wondered why on earth he had chosen to come here, alone in December. The air was hard, ice-edged, and laden with the salt of the sea. Runcorn was a Londoner, used to the rattle of hansom cabs on the cobbles, the gas lamps gleaming in the afternoon dusk. Every day he was surrounded by the sing-song voices of costermongers, the cries of news vendors, drivers of every kind of vehicle&#x2014;broughams to drays&#x2014;and the air carried the smell of smoke and manure.<br><br>This isolated island must be the loneliest place in Britain, all bare hills and hard, bright water, and silence except for the moan of the wind in the grass. The black skeleton of the Menai Bridge had a certain grace, but it was a cold elegance, not the low, familiar arches across the Thames. The few lights flickering on in the town of Beaumaris behind him indicated nothing like the vast city he was used to, teeming with the passions, the sorrow, and the dreams of millions.<br><br>Of course the reason he was here was simple. Runcorn had nowhere else in particular to be for Christmas, no family. He lived alone. He knew many people, but they were colleagues rather than friends. He had earned his promotions until he was now, at fifty, a senior superintendent in the Metropolitan Police, separated by office from those he had once worked beside. But he was not a gentleman, like those of his own rank. He had not the polish, the confidence, the ease of speech and grace of movement that comes with not having to care what people thought of you.<br><br>He smiled to himself as the wind stung his face. Monk, his colleague many years ago, one of his few friends, had not been born a gentleman either, but somehow he had always managed to seem like one. That used to hurt, but it did not anymore. He knew that Monk was human too, and vulnerable. He could make mistakes. And perhaps Runcorn himself was wiser.<br><br>The last case in which they had worked together had been difficult and in the end ugly. Now Runcorn was tired of the city and he was due several weeks of leave. Why not take it somewhere as different as possible? He would refresh his mind away from the familiar and predictable, take long walks in the open, think deeply for a change.<br><br>The sun was sinking in the southwest, shedding brilliant, burning light over the water. The land was dark as the color faded and the headlands jutted purple and black out of the sea. Only the uplands, ribbed pale like crumpled velvet, still caught the last rays of light.<br><br>How long was winter twilight here? Would he soon find himself lost, unable to see the way back to his lodgings? It was bitterly cold already. His feet were numb from standing. Turning, he started to walk towards the east and the darkening sky. What was there to think about? He was good at his job, patient, possibly a little pedestrian. He never had flashes of brilliant intuition, but he got where he needed to. He had succeeded far more than any of the other young men who had started when he had. In fact, his own success had surprised him.<br><br>But was he happy?<br><br>That was a stupid question, as if happiness were something you could own and have for always. He was happy at times, as for example when a case was closed and he knew he had done it well, found a difficult truth and left no doubts to haunt him afterwards, no savage and half-answered questions.<br><br>He was happy when he sat down by the fire at the end of a long day, took the weight off his feet, and ate something really good, like a thick-crusted ham-and-egg pie, or hot sausages with mashed potatoes. He liked good music, even classical music sometimes, although he would not admit it, in case people thought he was putting on airs. And he liked dogs. A good dog always made him smile. Was that enough?<br><br>He could only just see the road at his feet now. He thought about the huge bridge behind him, spanning the whole surge and power of the sea. What about the man who built that? Had he been happy? He had certainly created something to marvel at, and changed the lives of people far into the future.<br><br>Runcorn had untangled a few problems, but had he ever built anything, or did he always use other people&#x2019;s bridges? Where did he go, anyway? No more than home to bed. Tonight it was to be an unfamiliar lodging house. It was comfortable. He would sleep well, he usually did. Certainly it was warm enough, and Mrs. Owen was an agreeable woman, generous in nature.<br>The next morning was sharp and cold, but a pale sun struggled over the horizon, milky soft through a fine veil of cloud, which Mrs. Owen assured him would burn off soon. The frost was only a dusting of white here and there, enough to make the hollows stand out on the long, uneven lawn stretching down to the big yew tree.<br><br>Runcorn ate a hearty breakfast, talked with Mrs. Owen for a little while because it was only civil to appear interested as she told him about some of the local places and customs. Afterwards he set out to walk again.<br><br>This time he headed uphill, climbing steadily until nearly midday when he turned and gazed out at a cloudless sky, and a sea shimmering unbroken into the distance.<br><br>He stood there for some time, lost in the enormity of it, then gradually descended. He was on the outskirts of Beaumaris again when he turned a corner in the road and came face-to-face with a tall, slender man of unusual elegance, even in his heavy, winter coat and hat. He was in his mid-thirties, handsome, clean-shaven. They both stopped, staring at each other. The man blinked, uncertain except recognizing Runcorn&#x2019;s face as familiar.</p><h2>High Conflict People in Legal Disputes</h2><p>High Conflict People in Legal Disputes</p><p></p><h2>The Upland Shooting Life (1st Edition)</h2><p>&#34;A Basic Shooting Book By A Writer-Shooter Who Shares With His Readers A Lifetime Of Experience In The Fields, The Pines, The Birches, The Alder Swamps, And The Brushy Borders - In Pursuit Of Grouse, Pheasant, Woodcock, And Other Upland Game.

Tour.</p><p>This book poses an interesting question: How is it that John Wayne came to embody a certain politics for America? In giving his answer, Wills flashes his usual encyclopedic knowledge of intellectual and cultural materials. He knows his Aristotle and his Groucho and knows when to use them. The knee-jerk analysis of Wayne's status is that he was a blustery flag-waver. Wills's answer is more subtle: that Wayne "stood for an America that was disappearing or had disappeared." And according to Wills, Wayne did this in different ways at different stages of his career. In his early successes (such as <i>Stagecoach</i>), he represented naive virtue; later he would portray the dark acceptance of responsibility (<i>Sands of Iwo Jima</i>). And finally, he moved on to model a conscious acceptance of the anachronism of all such individual honor (<i>The Shootist</i>).Eighteen years after his death, John Wayne is still America's favorite movie star. He was less an actor than a symbol, the most popular pop icon of the twentieth century, and one of the most important political figures in America. People shaped their lives or adopted political stands to conform to him as a template of authentic Americanism. Wayne became the lens through which people saw their own and their country's history. In this brilliant, ground-breaking study of the relationship between politics and popular culture, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills focuses on the manufacture of "John Wayne" from the raw materials of Marion Morrison, the person born in Iowa who became a myth, his own reality swallowed up in his meaning as master directors such as John Ford crafted films that made him the personification of America's frontier myth. <p>Unlike other actors and actresses with whom we associate political views, Wayne embodied a politics of large meanings -- a politics of gender (masculine), ideology (patriotism), character (self-reliance), and personal responsibility. It was a politics of implicit dogmas that often transcended his own views and behavior. Although Wayne avoided serving in the military during World War II, he became, through his screen roles, the model of the American soldier. Likewise, although Wayne's popular image is that of a staunch anti-Communist, in reality he avoided taking a stand in the bitter ideological war that raged in Hollywood until after the issue had been decided. </p><p>Wayne acquired his larger political meaning gradually, as he moved from one film role to the next: from the young, individualist cowboy hero (the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach) to the middle-aged authority figure weighed down with responsibility (Sergeant Stryker in Sands of Iwo Jima) to the cool, determined patriot in the midst of Cold War dangers (represented by Davy Crockett in The Alamo) to the elderly lone survivor of a past heroic time (Rooster Cogburn in True Grit). Wayne himself became aware of his larger political meaning only through a progressive act of self-identification, in much the same way that his fans came to associate their ideals with his screen personae. </p><p>In this work of great originality, the biography of an idea, Wills shows how John Wayne and the Hollywood image factories distorted or ignored important facts of Wayne's life to create his myth. Wills shows for the first time how Wayne, through his screen characters, spoke to the needs of his audience at crucial periods in American history, and how in response Americans invested their emotions in that embodiment of their deepest myths. </p><p>John Wayne's America traces the way Wayne's countrymen became "entangled in his story, by the dreams he shaped or inhibited, in us or in others, by the things he validated and those he scorned, by the particular definition he gave to 'being American."</p></p><h2>Beethoven: The Universal Composer (Eminent Lives)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Brilliant....This book is a perfect marriage&#x2014;or should one say, duet&#x2014;of subject and author, every word as masterly as the notes of the artist it illuminates.&#x201d; &#x2014; Christopher Buckley, <em>Forbes</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is not just criticism but poetry in itself, with the additional&#x2014;and inestimable&#x2014;merit of being true.&#x201d; &#x2014; <em>Washington Post Book World</em> </p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edmund Morris (<em>The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, Theodore Rex, Dutch</em>) is one of America&#x2019;s most distinguished biographers, known for his rich, compulsively readable prose style.

Geller, Presley's hairdresser, who describes himself as a confidant and spiritual advisor to the late singer, kept a diary that is the basis for this book. The biography is easily read, evenhanded, straightforward, unapologetic, and seemingly unbiased. The material is treated with care, thought, and cool reason. Elvis fans will find the book a curiosity, appealing in many ways. The people described are at once naive and licentious. There is a dedication to excellence in musical performance and hairdressing coupled with a chilling absence of discipline in almost any other aspect of living. Puritanical attitudes live side-by-side with sensual gratifications, including gluttony, greed, and lust. The incredible career of Elvis Presley will capture the interest of secondary students, for the legendary star was and continues to be a figure in American life. The book's most valuable asset may be the honesty with which the authors describe a bizarre way of life, destroyed by excessive quantities of money, ignorance, and foolishness.<br><i>- Dortha Dee Vaughan, Port Arthur I.S.D., TX</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Romanowski ( Dreamgirl ) and Broadway producer Spector collaborate here with Presley spiritual adviser and hairdresser Geller to present the singer in a better light than he has been shown in previous books. Despite a pervasive self-serving tone, the book accomplishes that even though there is scandal aplenty: Presley's drug abuse, the perfidies of Col. Tom Parker and the excesses of the "Memphis Mafia." But the authors emphasize Presley's positive traits, his extraordinary generosity, his sensitivity and loyalty. We're also told that he was quite intelligent and surprisingly well-read. Much of the book focuses on the star's pursuit of spiritual understanding, and his and Geller's mutual exploration of esoteric philosophies. Presley fans will be gratified by the confirmation that the King was a fine fellow; detractors will discover little new fodder here.

A military genius and master of sorcery whose story stretches back to before the dawn of history. Now, after a long absence, the undead Sethra Lavode, the Enchantress of Dzur Mountain, has reentered the Empire's affairs. And the affairs of Khaavren and Pel, Tazendra and Aerich, and all their descendants, colleagues, and friends.<br><br>For since Adron&#x2019;s Disaster, when Dragaera City was turned instantly into a sea of amorphia, the Empire has been in ruins. Trade has declined, brigands rule the roads, plagues sweep through the population. Now an ambitious Dragonlord means to rebuild the Empire in his own name. But unknown to him, the true heir, the Phoenix Zerika, has already retrieved the Imperial Orb from the Paths of the Dead. Sethra Lavode means to see Zerika on the throne. To do so will entail a climactic battle of sorcery and arms, told with all the swashbuckling flair for which Steven Brust is known.<br><br><i>Sethra Lavode</i> is the sequel to <i>The Paths of the Dead</i> and <i>The Lord of Castle Black</i>, and the culmination of the bestselling epic begun with <i>The Phoenix Guards.</i></p></p><p>Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and raised in a family of labor organizers, Steven Brust worked as a musician and a computer programmer before coming to prominence as a writer in 1983 with <i>Jhereg</i>, the first of his novels about Vlad Taltos, a human professional assassin in a world dominated by long-lived, magically-empowered human-like "Dragaerans." <br><br>Over the next several years, several more "Taltos" novels followed, interspersed with other work, including <i>To Reign in Hell</i>, a fantasy re-working of Milton's war in Heaven; <i>The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars</i>, a contemporary fantasy based on Hungarian folktales; and a science fiction novel, <i>Cowboy Feng's Space Bar and Grille</i>. The most recent "Taltos" novels are <i>Dragon</i> and<i> Issola</i>. In 1991, with <i>The Phoenix Guards</i>, Brust began another series, set a thousand years earlier than the Taltos books; its sequels are <i>Five Hundred Years After</i> and the three volumes of "The Viscount of Adrilankha": <i>The Paths of the Dead, The Lord of Castle Black, </i>and<i> Sethra Lavode</i>.<br><br>While writing, Brust has continued to work as a musician, playing drums for the legendary band Cats Laughing and recording an album of his own work, <i>A Rose for Iconoclastes</i>. He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada where he pursues an ongoing interest in stochastics. <br>Chapter the Sixty-Ninth<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>How the Empress, Attempting to</i><br><i>Work on the Design of the Imperial Palace,</i><br><i>Manages Those Who Interrupt Her</i><br>&nbsp;<br>On the ground floor of Whitecrest Manor was a wide enclosed terrace, the twin to the open terrace on the other side where the Count and Countess of Whitecrest were accustomed to take their morning klava and watch the ocean. The enclosed terrace, of course, was used during inclement weather and had been the place where the Countess was accustomed to carry on her work--except that now it was the room where the Empress was carrying on her official business. The room was reached by a hallway with two entrances, one leading down to the parlor, and the other to a flight of steps that went up to the second story of the Manor. This second entrance had been sealed off, and a guard was posted at the first, with instructions to admit no one without permission of either Her Majesty or the officer on duty.<br>The officer on duty, of course, was generally Khaavren, and it happened to be Khaavren on this day who entered the room, bowed to Zerika, and said, "A gentleman to see Your Majesty. It is Prince Tiwall, of the House of the Hawk."<br>"Ah!" said Zerika, looking up from the papers she had been studying, which papers were, in turn, a single entry in a seemingly endless list of details to be decided upon with regard to the design of the Imperial Palace. Before her were not only lists and diagrams, but several different models of the future structures, or portions there-of, one of which was a full five feet high and more than fifteen feet in length, and occupied most of the room.<br>This activity had taken up so much of Her Majesty's time and effort that she was often impatient with any interruptions. On hearing who was there, the Orb, which had been circling her head with a beige color of distraction, first turned to a faint red of irritation, then, after she had reflected, to a warm orange of pleasurable excitement. "Send him in at once," she said.<br>Khaavren bowed and, as he had been trained to do for so long, did as he was told.<br>"I greet Your Majesty," said Tiwall, a stern, forbidding gentleman of well over two thousand years, whose white hair, worn long and brushed back from his noble's point, made a stark contrast to his dark complexion.<br>"Come, Your Highness," said Zerika. "That isn't so bad. You greet me as Your Majesty. Does this mean that I have cause to hope the House of the Hawk looks with favor upon my claim?"<br>Tiwall bowed. "I use the title because of my own belief, madam, that the Orb is the Empire."<br>"Your own belief--what of your House?"<br>"Oh, as to my House--"<br>"Well?"<br>"They are considering the matter."<br>"Considering it?"<br>"Your Majesty must understand that these are difficult times, and no one wishes to be hasty."<br>"Yet, Your Highness has decided."<br>"I have, and I beg Your Majesty to believe that I am using all of my influence within the House on your behalf."<br>"I am glad to hear it. For my part, I shall be glad to use what influence I have on Your Highness's behalf."<br>"Oh, if Your Majesty means that--"<br>"Yes?" said Zerika, frowning.<br>"It could be of immeasurable help in that cause in which we are united."<br>"I do not understand what Your Highness does me the honor to tell me. Speak more plainly, I beg."<br>"I only wish to say that should Your Majesty act on my behalf, or, more precisely, on behalf of my House, it would be of great help to me in convincing them."<br>&nbsp;Zerika looked at him carefully. "Does the House of the Hawk wish to bargain with the Empire?"<br>"It is their contention--and believe me, I speak of them, not of me--that, not having been recognized by the Council of Princes, it is not yet the Empire."<br>"I see. So, then, the House of the Hawk wishes to bargain with a certain Phoenix who happens to have the Orb circling her head."<br>"Your Majesty has stated the situation admirably."<br>"I see. And what does the House of the Hawk feel this recognition is worth?"<br>"If Your Majesty will permit me, before I answer the question you have done me the honor to ask."<br>"Permit you to what, Highness?"<br>"To explain the situation as I see it. Perhaps there are aspects that I fail to understand."<br>"I doubt that," murmured Zerika. Then she said, "Very well, Prince. State the situation as you understand it."<br>Tiwall bowed and said, "Well, let us see. You already have approval of the Lyorn, have you not?"<br>"The Count of Flowerpot Hill and Environs came to Adrilankha within days of my arrival here, and at once pledged the support of his House."<br>"And of course, you have the support of the House of the Phoenix."<br>"As I am the only one in the House, yes, it is true that I gave myself my full support. And I even plan to continue doing so."<br>"But Your Majesty has not yet heard from the Dragon or the Athyra, which are, I should point out, the two most powerful Houses."<br>"Again, you are correct."<br>"It must be said that the indications of allegiance you have received from the Tiassa are important. They have influence."<br>"I received a letter only yester-day from Count R�aanac in which he informs me of the decision of his House and pledges his personal good-will. Your Highness is singularly well informed."<br>Tiwall bowed and said, "So then, will Your Majesty permit me to make an observation?"<br>"Certainly, Highness. Do so, by all means, especially if it brings us to the point of this political survey you have just made for my benefit."<br>Tiwall, after clearing his throat, said, "My House occupies an unusual middle ground. We have more influence than the Jhereg and the Teckla, but not so much as the Dragon and the Athyra. We have been consulted--informally, I should add--by parties from the Issola and the Iorich, as well as certain of the merchant Houses."<br>"Very well, go on."<br>"Should I manage to persuade my House to accept Your Majesty as the Empress that you are, well--"<br>"Yes, if you should convince them, as I know you are trying to do?"<br>"I am certain we would bring with us, as a matter of course, the Iorich, the Chreotha, and most probably the Orca as well."<br>"I see."<br>"Once that happens, I cannot imagine the Jhereg and the Teckla not falling into line."<br>"It seems as if Your Highness is doing my planning for me."<br>"Not in the least, Your Majesty. I'm attempting to explain--"<br>"Never mind, Highness. Go on."<br>"Yes, Your Majesty. I wish only to observe that, should my negotiations within my own House be successful, it may have the effect, by itself, of very nearly bringing the entire Council of Princes to Your Majesty's support."<br>Zerika remained silent, and the Orb, slowing down a trifle in response to this contemplation, took on a dark green shade as she considered, as well as flickering slightly when she consulted it for some detail on Tiwall's history or family. To be sure, this Hawklord was no one's fool, and he was, as Hawks always are, well informed. But how honest was he, within the lies he was telling that were meant to be seen through?<br>"Very well," said Zerika after a moment. "What might the Empire grant your House that could help you to convince them that I am the true Empress, representing their interests as well as everyone else's within the vast Empire that we once had and, with the Favor, will again?"<br>"Tolerably little, Majesty."<br>"We shall see."<br>"An estate."<br>"That is easy enough; there are many estates."<br>"A particular estate, Majesty."<br>"Then that is different. Who owns it now?"<br>"No one. That is to say, the Empire."<br>"So much the better. Is it valuable?"<br>"I will not deny to Your Majesty that it is."<br>"What is its value?"<br>"Nowhere else that I know of are iron ore, oil, and coal all to be found in the same, narrow region of a few small mountains and valleys. There are refining operations near-by where, before the disaster, kerosene was produced, and there is no shortage of waterways."<br>"And you say, these counties are not owned?"<br>"Not one of them. A few had a baron or two ruling part of them before the Disaster, but since then not even a younger son of any of them remain."<br>"How many counties are we speaking of?"<br>"Five"<br>"How much in area?"<br>"Perhaps twelve hundred square miles."<br>"That is not so much. Where are these counties, exactly?"<br>"Just south of the Collier Hills."<br>"Ah, ah!"<br>"Your Majesty knows them?"<br>"Nearly. I have just promised three of them to a certain Dragonlord who gave me some assistance against the Pretender. I had no idea they were so valuable."<br>"You have promised them? Ah, that is too bad!"<br>"Is there nothing else that will do?"<br>"I fear not, Your Majesty," said the Hawk, bowing deeply. "If I may be excused--"<br>"Your Highness may not," said Zerika coldly.<br>Tiwall bowed again, and waited in the perfect attitude of the courtier.<br>The Empress was discovering, as Morrolan had, that to govern others requires one to spend more time in consideration than one is used to--either that, or one must inevitably become a careless administrator, and history says nothing good about careless administrators. Therefore, Zerika considered, and, after considering, she said, "Very well, you may have your five counties."<br>The Hawklord bowed. "I believe I will be able to bring Your Majesty good news within a month."<br>"I depend upon it."<br>"Oh," he said, suddenly looking worried. "I hope Your Majesty did not interpret my words as a guarantee for any House other than my own."<br>"I hope," replied the Empress, "that Your Highness did not interpret my words as a guarantee of five counties to be given to your House."<br>"And yet--I understand, Your Majesty."<br>"That is good, Highness. It is important to understand one another."<br>Tiwall bowed to acknowledge this observation Her Majesty did him the honor to share, and inquired, "Will there be anything else?"<br>"No. You may go."<br>"Your Majesty will hear from me soon."<br>When he was gone, Zerika returned to her work, comparing certain figures on paper to some of the models and drumming her fingertips on the table, until the captain once again entered the room, and said, "Another gentleman begs to have a word with Your Majesty."<br>Zerika had been reflecting on what sort of passageway ought to connect the Imperial Wing with the Iorich Wing, which included certain philosophical issues about the relationship between the needs of the Empire and the abstraction of justice and therefore could not be easily delegated. She permitted a grimace to cross her countenance as she said, "Who is it this time?"<br>"It is I," said Khaavren.<br>"Yes, yes. But I mean, who wishes to see me?"<br>"The captain of your guard," said Khaavren coolly.<br>"But you are the captain of my guard."<br>"Then, it appears, it is I who wish to have a word with my Empress."<br>Her Majesty's eyes narrowed, and she said, "You must break yourself of this habit, Captain, of answering in tones that might be construed as deficient in respect for the Orb. Even when we are alone, I do not consider it in the best of taste, and I am surprised that an old soldier such as yourself, who has served the Empire for so many years, would permit himself such liberties."<br>"I beg Your Majesty's pardon," said Khaavren. "With age, we soldiers become brittle, and the least pressure upon us causes us to snap back quickly lest we break."<br>"I do not believe, Captain, that you are in any danger of breaking."<br>"I beg Your Majesty's pardon, but I must do myself the honor of disagreeing."<br>"You say, then, that you are in danger of breaking?"<br>"Your Majesty must know that I am old."<br>Zerika quickly consulted the Orb, and did some fast arithmetic, after which she said, "My dear Captain, you have not seen a thousand years."<br>"That is true, but Your Majesty ought to understand that each year of Interregnum, now thankfully passed--"<br>"As to that, we shall see, with the Favor."<br>"--must count as ten years when calculating my age."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>"So many?"<br>"At the very least."<br>"Well, perhaps the Tiassa do not reckon figures as others do."<br>"That may be; but I swear it is the truth."<br>"Very well, then, Captain, I accept that you are old. What of it? Your service is still valuable."<br>"Oh, it is good of Your Majesty to say so."<br>"Not at all. I hope, at least, you do not dispute me on this as well?"<br>"Alas--"<br>"What, you say that you are no longer useful to me?"<br>"I am old, Your Majesty, and tired. I feel that, in having the honor to have served Your Majesty in so far as arriving to Adrilankha, I have done my duty."<br>"So then? What are you saying, Captain. Speak plainly."<br>"Your Majesty, I wish to offer you my resignation."<br>"What? I cannot believe it! You? Resign?"<br>"It is my fondest wish, Majesty."<br>"You offer your resignation."<br>"Exactly."<br>"And if I do not accept it?"<br>"Then I must find a way to convince Your Majesty to do so." He placed a paper on the table in front of her. "Here are a list of certain of my officers in whom I have great confidence; some of them were with me before the Disaster. Any of them can easily step into my boots."<br>"But why, Captain? Come, speak frankly."<br>"I have already had the honor to do so."<br>Zerika looked at the soldier carefully, noting his unbent posture, the attitude of humble respect that can only come from one who is secure of his own place, the lines of sorrow and joy on his face. At length, she said, "My lord, you are not being entirely honest with me."<br>"Your Majesty?"<br>"Do you require me to repeat myself?"<br>"I heard, but I do not understand."<br>"What could be plainer? I believe that you wish to resign, but I do not believe you have told me the true reason."<br>"I can only do myself the honor of repeating myself to Your Majesty, and, as that might be considered disrespectful, I must refrain from doing so, wherefore I stand mute."<br>"Permit me to observe, Captain, that you require more words to stand mute than you should have required to answer my question. So now I do myself the honor of asking again. Why do you wish to leave my service? Does it have something to do with your son, with whom you have quarreled?"<br>At these words, Khaavren stiffened almost imperceptibly, but he looked the Empress fully in the face and said, "No."<br>"Well then, what is the reason?"<br>Khaavren bowed his head and stood mute, this time without accompanying explanations.<br>The Orb turned to a dark, forbidding red, and Zerika slapped her palm upon the table. "Very well, then, Captain. You have tendered your resignation; I accept it. Farewell."<br>Khaavren bowed low to Her Majesty, and turning crisply on his heel, left the Empress's presence at a good, martial pace, which carried him, after two steps, to the Countess's apartment. The door being open, he passed within. Daro--whom we confess to our shame has been unfairly neglected by this history--had been, since giving the Manor over to Her Majesty, using the small secretary to carry out the business of the county. She looked up from this work as Khaavren entered, and stood up, smiling. Khaavren at once approached her and tenderly kissed her hand.<br>"It is such a pleasure, Countess, to be home, because I am able to see you every day."<br>"I give you my word, sir, that I share fully in this pleasure. But come, do not s...</p><h2>Kryon: The New Beginning (2002 and Beyond) Book Nine</h2><p>&#34;Kryon: The 11 Beginning (2002 and Beyond) Book Nine [Paperback] by Carroll, Lee&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Death of a Scriptwriter (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 14)</h2><p><i>From the author of the Agatha Raisin television series...</i><b>DEATH OF A SCRIPTWRITER: A Hamish Macbeth Mystery</b> HOLLYWOOD IN THE HIGHLANDS<br>With the lovely Priscilla Halburton-Smythe away in London, Lochdubh Constable Hamish Macbeth pines for company during the long Scottish winter. He gets his wish -- and more -- when a troupe of flashy, urbane filmmakers clamors into the nearby town of Drim. Before long bedlam erupts around their make-believe mystery ...and culminates in the sudden appearance of one very real corpse.<br>The initial suspect in the killing is one Patricia Martyn-Broyd, the aging mystery writer furious that her musty old cozies are getting a risque face-lift in their TV reincarnation. Yet, going behind the scenes, Hamish soon finds a town full of locals bitten by the movie bug and a cast of quarreling show business types, all harboring their own secrets, lies, and hidden agendas. And as the culprit strikes again, Hamish must quickly find the right killer -- or script the wrong finale to a show gone murderously awry.</p><p>M.C. Beaton's 14th adventure featuring Hamish Macbeth, lovable local bobby of Lochdubh, Scotland, is a similar treat to her previous efforts. Macbeth feels a dismal foreboding when television film crews descend into his neighborhood to film a local author's out-of-print mysteries. Not only are they led by an overbearing and egotistical scriptwriter, but they have completely stood the original manuscript on its head. The producers have determined that a sexy, pot-smoking heroine will bring in more viewers than the genteel and circumspect detective true to the original. The author herself and the local Calvinist minister are not amused. Before too long, the scriptwriter, the shapely actress playing the lead, and her jealous husband all end up dead, confirming Macbeth's suspicions that the gloomy village of Drim and glamorous media types were a dangerously combustible mix. <p> The mystery itself seems straightforward enough, but Beaton has provided more than the usual number of suspects and subplots. All of these spike the reader's interest while her wicked characterizations of both the locals and the inhabitants of TV-land are hilarious, and very occasionally thought-provoking. The real strength of the book, and indeed Beaton's work in general, is the way in which she evokes the genuine isolation of Macbeth's rural Highlands and blends it with breezy renderings of murder, mayhem, and cozy cups of tea. In some ways it's a bit of an incongruous mix, but Beaton successfully keeps the tone on the lighter side. <i>Death of a Scriptwriter</i> will certainly intrigue mystery fans as well as those who have wondered about the creations of the PBS/BBC series <i>Mystery!</i> <i>--K.A. Crouch</i></p>Patricia Martyn-Broyd was not an easy woman to like. The hawk-nosed spinster had retired to Scotland, unable to write another book since her 1965 mystery featuring the aristocratic Scottish detective Lady Harriet Vere. Local constable Hamish Macbeth thought Patricia must be lonely beneath her rigid pride. A bit lonely himself since the breakup of his engagement, he extended his friendship. But that was before fame and the movie people arrived... A British TV company had decided to feature Lady Harriet in a new series. The constable knew there would be trouble between the middle-aged, dour townsfolk and the flashy, urbane filmmakers. And there was - murder. When one of the scriptwriters for the series is found dead, the tension escalates on the set and in the streets of Drim. And as Hamish pokes into the town&#39;s secrets and the TV people&#39;s hidden agendas, he finds a large cast of people who wanted to cut out the writer for good - from the boozehound husband jealous of his actress wife&#39;s flagrant flirting to the tough, ambitious producer who was threatened with dismissal.</p><h2>The Complete Book of Bible Answers: Answering the Tough Questions</h2><p>Tackling the difficult issues, popular bible teacher Ron Rhodes offers straightforward, easy-to-understand responses to your questions about God, faith, and living for Christ, drawn from his five years of participation on the &#34;Bible Answer Man&#34; program.</p><p></p><h2>La Belle Sauvage : the Book of Dust (Book 1)</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Though Herman relates losing his lover to AIDS, and tells of his own HIV status, of plagiarism disputes, and of in-fighting with Broadway producers, his tone remains conversational and cheerfully upbeat.Notwithstanding frank discussion of his homosexuality and HIV- positive status, the composer-lyricist of Hello, Dolly!, Mame, and La Cage aux Folles delivers a memoir as old-fashioned as his shows: exuberant, stagestruck, over-gushy at times, and unabashedly self- infatuated. The opening chapters are best, as 17-year-old Jerry, untrained but gifted, encouraged by his doting mother (who died before he made it to Broadway) and family acquaintance Frank Loesser, heads out from Jersey City to devote his life to showtunes: theater studies at the University of Miami; playing piano at supper clubs (listening hard to Mabel Mercer); scoring with little revues--and with his Broadway debut, Milk and Honey, featuring a show-stopper for Molly Picon (``What a moment!''). Then Herman wrote four songs in three days on spec for ``monster'' David Merrick--who made him rich and famous from Dolly! but scarred him forever with sadistic mind-games on the road. (Another Dolly! scar: a plagiarism lawsuit that Herman settled so as not to kill the movie deal.) Mame--except for the pain of Lucille Ball's movie-version singing--and La Cage were Herman's greatest collaborative joys. In between came disappointments (Dear World and Mack and Mabel--which became a London hit 20 years later), bitterness about being dismissed by the Sondheim-admiring theater clique, and years of depression. And along the way there's a late-blooming love life (including a long relationship ended by AIDS), houses to decorate, and loyal pals like Carol Channing and Angela Lansbury. With generous excerpts from song lyrics, mini-tributes to a slew of stars, and a heap of that-number-brought-down-the-house anecdotes: a glossily upbeat rendition of ``I Am What I Am,'' chiefly but not exclusively for fans.

Not for long!</b><br><br>Terrorist attacks, debt, and big government plague the United States. The very foundation of our nation wobbles on shaky ground. Chuck Norris wants to change all that by reigniting the American dream, a dream of faith and freedom in what still should be the land of opportunity. The martial arts master sets out to kickstart America&#x2019;s heart and return us to a country of tradition using practical advice from the Founding Fathers to modern conservatives.<br><br>Spring into action and revitalize your country with Chuck Norris's dynamic book <i>Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America</i>.</p><p>Wake Up, America! <p> It seems like wherever you turn these days, the news is bad. Illegal immigrants are swarming over our borders. Our nation and American families are crippled by debt. We remain vulnerable to Islamist terrorist attacks. Judges ignore the Constitution and instead legislate from the bench. Faith and traditional values are under incessant assault from the media, leftist lawyers, and the liberal establishment. The core message of the Declaration of Independence--that everyone has a God-given right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--is under threat from liberals who deny the right to life (or even the very idea of God-given rights), and who think the answer to every problem is a government program. They think that God, if He exists, might not know best, but liberal-run government certainly does. If you're worried about the direction our country is going, you're in good company. Chuck Norris remembers a better America--an America of faith, freedom, and respect for tradition, history, and human life--and in <i>Black Belt Patriotism</i> he shows what we need to do to reawaken the American dream, reignite the American spirit, and give our children and grandchildren the America they deserve: an America of freedom, opportunity, and faith. In ten practical, down-to-earth chapters, Norris gets back to basics, mining the insights of our founding fathers and applying their wisdom to the problems of today: immigration, the culture wars, the war against global terrorism, national (and personal) debt, even the epidemic of obesity that is killing more Americans than terrorists do. With the optimistic, get your-hands-dirty, can-do spirit that typifies what's best about America, Chuck Norris grapples with the toughest problems facing our country and proves that they're no match for <i>Black Belt Patriotism</i>.</p><i>Black Belt Patriotism</i> is my critique of what is destroying our country, and offers my solutions for rebuilding America and restoring the American dream. It's "black belt" in the sense that it is strong, resolute and to the point, like a roundhouse kick. It's "patriotic" in the sense that it recaptures the vision of America's Founding Fathers. I wrote this book in the hope that future generations of Americans can continue to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p><h2>Leaves of Grass (150th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p><p>This collection remains the incomparable achievement of one of America's greatest poets-a passionate man who loved his country and wrote of it as no other has ever done.</p></p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Nelson: The Sword of Albion by Sugden, John (2012) Hardcover</h2><p>Nelson: we think that we are familiar with the man behind the name. But, in this second volume of his authoritative biography, John Sugden delves behind the myths, strips back the apocrypha, and reveals a figure both intimately familiar and greatly estranged.Sugden interweaves graphic accounts of the well-known battles of the Nile, Copenhagen and Trafalgar with Nelson&#39;s lesser-known but equally gripping campaigns to liberate the Italian states from French domination, his role in the blockade of Malta and his turbulent relations with the volatile Barbary powers, often snatching remarkable triumphs from crippling reverses. But behind his military prowess was a man riven with paradoxes and schisms at the very heart of his personal life. Sugden paints a vivid composition of Nelson as glory-hunter and national hero, humanitarian and hardened military leader, family man and adulterer.Sugden opens up to us a man who was ever thwarted in his quest for happiness and pers</p><p>DR. JOHN SUGDEN has pursued a busy trans-Atlantic career as a lecturer, senior research fellow and writer. He is the author of a series of acclaimed articles and books, including <i>Sir Francis Drake, Tecumseh: A Life</i>, which won the Distinguished Book Award of the American Society for Military History, and <i>Blue Jacket</i>, which won the Ohioana Award. His fascination with Nelson stems from childhood, and he decided to write a complete life of Nelson when he discovered large amounts of untapped material whilst completing his doctorate in naval and political history.Admiral Horatio Nelson, along with Captain James Cook, is at the forefront in the pantheon of British naval heroes. This is the second and concluding volume of Sugden&#x2019;s massive and meticulously researched biography. Here Sugden covers the latter part of Nelson&#x2019;s personal life as well as the greatest triumphs of his military career, including the battles of the Nile and, of course, Trafalgar. Sugden pays full tribute to Nelson&#x2019;s tactical brilliance, his leadership skills, and his passionate devotion to duty and country. Yet, if Nelson did not have feet of clay, he was a deeply flawed man who seemed incapable of achieving contentment. Perhaps due to his nonaristocratic background, he had a deep sense of insecurity, which led to chronic friction with his fellow officers. He was trapped in an unsatisfying marriage, and his intense and long affair with Lady Hamilton was prone to severe ups and downs. Sugden&#x2019;s prose is sometimes dense, and his employment of naval jargon may overwhelm some laymen. Still, this is an ambitious and largely successful conclusion to a biography of a historical icon that has appeal for both scholars and general readers interested in British history. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>The Christmas Mystery</h2><p>The author of the critically acclaimed Sophie&#39;s World presents a Christmas adventure about a boy who discovers a magical Advent calendar in the corner of a dusty bookstore that takes him on an amazing holiday journey. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>In the corner of a dusty old bookstore, Joachim discovers a magic Advent calendar. When he opens the first door on December 1, a small piece of paper falls out. On it is the beginning of a story about a little girl named Elisabet. One December many years ago, Elisabet follows a white lamb straight out of Joachim&#39;s town and on to an amazing journey. She travels back through time and down through Europe to be present - along with the Wise Men and the shepherds, and other familiar figures - at the birth of Jesus. Each of the twenty-four windows in the calendar hides another chapter in Elisabet&#39;s story, along with illustrations. Through the mysterious calendar, Joachim and his parents get a new sense of the Nativity story and the meaning of Christmas. But they also start to wonder: Who was this Elisabet and where is she now? On Christmas Eve, all the pieces of this puzzle come together.Jostein Gaarder born in Oslo spent many years as a teacher before writing full time.

Before his 8X10 camera, they show their relationship not only one to another, but also of the inner self to the world. Magical in their detail, these images are a collaboration of trust and admiration between artist and subject. Jayne Anne Phillip&#39;s compelling prose both illuminates the photographs and explores the unending sensuality and complexity of the bond between mother and child.</p><p>Jock Sturges received a B.A. in Perceptual Psychology and Photography from Marlboro College in Vermont and an M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute. He has exhibited widely in the United States as well as in France and Japan. His photographs are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Biblioth�que Nationale in Paris."In the fifty-eight images of this handsome, cleanly designed monograph, Sturges sustains a delicate balance on a very precarious wire. He engages us through the tension of polarities: between public and private, between tact and frankness, between childhood and adolescence, between male and female, between artist and model...His purity of intent shines through in the images. His struggle is to observe and render his subjects in all of their complexities, trembling on the cusp of change. The result of this long-term, communal effort is one of the most clear-eyed, responsible investigations of puberty and the emergence of sexuality in the medium's history, making a metaphor of the metamorphosis from child to adult."--A. D. Coleman, "The New York Observer" <br>"This is a truly beautiful and compelling group of photographs, an expression of innocence not lost by knowledge."--Eric Fischl <br>"The gelatin silver prints luxuriate in textures of sand, flesh, cloth, tide pools and gentle waves...superbly printed, expressive in their modulations of light and joyful tonalities...the high mark of Sturges' work is its naturalness, its gentle attentions to the pleasure that can be found in life."--Kelly Wise, "The Boston Globe"<br></p><h2>Mister Slaughter</h2><p>The world of Colonial America comes vibrantly to life in this masterful new historical thriller by Robert McCammon. The latest entry in the popular Matthew Corbett series, which began with Speaks the Nightbird and continued in The Queen of Bedlam, Mister Slaughter opens in the emerging metropolis of New York City in 1702, and proceeds to take both Matthew and the reader on an unforgettable journey of horror, violence, and personal discovery. The journey begins when Matthew, now an apprentice &#34;problem solver&#34; for the London-based Herrald Agency, accepts an unusual and hazardous commission. Together with his colleague, Hudson Greathouse, he agrees to escort the notorious mass murderer Tyranthus Slaughter from an asylum outside Philadelphia to the docks of New York. Along the way, Slaughter makes his captors a surprising - and extremely tempting - offer. Mister Slaughter is at once a classic portrait of an archetypal serial killer and an exquisitely detailed account of a fledgling nation still in the process of inventing itself.</p><p>Murder and ghoulish mayhem are the order of the day in bestseller McCammon's colorful third thriller featuring �&#x20ac;&#x153;problem-solver�&#x20ac; Matthew Corbett and his escapades in early 18th-century America. After confronting a criminal mastermind in <i>The Queen of Bedlam</i> (2007), Matthew finds himself a celebrity whose exploits have become sensational fodder for colonial tabloids. This heady attention contributes to a bad lapse of judgment when he and his senior associate, Hudson Greathouse, accidentally allow a brutal murderer, Tyranthus Slaughter, to give them the slip while they transport him to prison in Philadelphia. The rousing narrative details Matthew's dogged pursuit of the indestructible Tyranthus as the killer cuts a bloody swath through the Pennsylvania wilderness. McCammon shows a sure hand balancing scenes of Matthew's quiet contemplation with the cold-blooded carnage that makes his quarry's name so appropriate. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lost sight in one eye while in Sri Lanka covering the civil war, interviewed Gaddafi and Arafat many times, and repeatedly risked her life covering conflicts in Chechnya, East Timor, Kosovo, and the Middle East. Colvin lived her personal life in extremis, too: bold, driven, and complex, she was married twice, took many lovers, drank and smoked, and rejected society&#x2019;s expectations for women. Despite PTSD, she refused to give up reporting.

SCHILLER</b> is a collector and rare book dealer (Justin G. Schiller Ltd. is the oldest specialist in antiquarian children&#x2019;s books). He was one of the principal founders of the International Wizard of Oz Club in 1957 (in 1956, at the age of twelve, his collection of L. Frank Baum Oz books went on exhibit at Columbia University for the centenary of the author&#x2019;s birth). Schiller helped finance his college education by issuing rare-book catalogues from his dormitory. In 1964 he was one of two American undergraduates selected for an eight-week Shakespeare symposium at Stratford-on-Avon, graduating the following year with honors in English Renaissance literature. Schiller is the author of a number of journal and magazine articles, including &#x201c;Sendak All Around&#x201d; (2003), as well as the catalogue <i>Sendak in Asia</i> (1996), and the books <i>Realms of Childhood</i> (1983), <i>Nonsensus</i> (1988), <i>Digging for Treasure: An Adventure in Appraising Rare and Collectible Children&#x2019;s Books</i> (1998), and <i>Pioneering Collectible Children&#x2019;s Books</i> (2002). Since 1967 he has compiled catalogues for various museum exhibitions throughout the United States and the world.<p></p><br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <b>DENNIS M. V. DAVID</b> came to the United States from his native Philippines in 1980 for graduate studies toward a master&#x2019;s degree in biology. Soon after, he was introduced to the world of rare children&#x2019;s books and Maurice Sendak. He studied paper conservation and restoration, learned how to research and catalogue old books, and ultimately began doing rare-book appraisal. Following the death of Arnold Lobel and evaluating the artwork in his estate, David collaborated with Justin Schiller to create Battledore Ltd. in 1988 as a business promoting illustration art. The 2013 Maurice Sendak exhibition at the Society of Illustrators also celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of Battledore.<p></p><br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <b>LEONARD S.

Alongside hundreds of images, focusing largely on sketches and commercial work that has not previously been reproduced, the text tours through Sendak&#39;s celebrated career and his impact on children&#39;s literature, with particular attention of course given to the classic Where the Wild Things Are and its characters&#39; afterlife in different media. The 12twelve gathered essays come from illustrators, publishers, librarians, and rare book dealers, most of whom were lucky enough to work with Sendak at one point or another. On a whole, they provide light and sentimental information on the artist, praising his wide-ranging work in occasionally breathless tones and applauding his contributions to everything from commercial illustration to opera, typically remaining brief if not quite pithy in doing so. The catalogue relies on its audience already being Sendak enthusiasts, but rarely delves deeply into his working methods or personal life, resulting in a pleasant but often superficial commemoration. If primarily for the images themselves, however, it manages to conjure a sweet sense of joy, and Sendak&#39;s own singular style transcends the sometimes cloying treatment it is given here.

Back then Specials were a sinister rumor -- frighteningly beautiful, dangerously strong, breathtakingly fast. Ordinary pretties might live their whole lives without meeting a Special. But Tally&#39;s never been ordinary. And now she&#39;s been turned into one of them: a superamped fighting machine, engineered to keep the uglies down and the pretties stupid. The strength, the speed, and the clarity and focus of her thinking feel better than anything Tally can remember. Most of the time. One tiny corner of her heart still remembers something more. Still, it&#39;s easy to tune that out -- until Tally&#39;s offered a chance to stamp out the rebels of the New Smoke permanently. It all comes down to one last choice: listen to that tiny, faint heartbeat, or carry out the mission she&#39;s programmed to complete.

In <em>Tears to Triumph</em>, she argues that we&#x2014;as a culture and as individuals&#x2014;have learned to avoid facing pain. By doing so, we are neglecting the spiritual work of healing.</p><p>Instead of allowing ourselves to embrace our hurt, we numb it, medicate it, dismiss it, or otherwise divert our attention so that we never have to face it. In refusing to acknowledge our suffering, we actually prolong it and deny ourselves the opportunity for profound wisdom&#x2014;ultimately limiting our personal growth and opportunity for enlightenment. Frozen by denial, we are left standing in the breech. Whole industries profit from this immobility, and while they have grown rich, we have become spiritually poorer.</p><p>As Marianne makes clear, true healing and transcendence can only come when we finally face our pain and wrestle with what it has to teach us. Written with warm compassion and profound wisdom, <em>Tears to Triumph</em> offers us a powerful way forward through the pain, to a deeper awareness of our feelings, our lives, and our true selves.</p></p><p><p>In each and every one of our lives, we will experience suffering. This is not a new problem. It is ageless. </p><p>Bestselling author, speaker, and activist Marianne Williamson helps us rediscover religious principles for dealing with and transcending our suffering. Many people today experience the emotional pain of depression, relational trauma, and grief without the knowledge of how to deal with them and find healing. As a culture and as individuals, we have neglected the spiritual work of facing and moving through our pain to find true healing. Instead, we numb our pain, medicate it, or deny it. As Williamson explains, in avoiding our pain, we avoid our growth. She offers an opportunity to transform our pain through spiritual healing. By turning to the wisdom of ancient spiritual teachers such as the Buddha, Moses, and Jesus, we can redirect our suffering so it becomes an opportunity for healing and enlightenment. </p><p>Miracles begin when we start the healing process of listening to what our pain has to teach us. Only in this way can we move from tears to triumph and become deeper, happier, and wiser as a result.</p><p>Marianne Williamson is an internationally acclaimed author, speaker, and activist. Six of her published books have been <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers.

But Sienna fascinates the primal heart of him, even as he tells himself she is far too young to handle the wild fury of the wolf. <br><br> Then Sienna changes the rules-and suddenly, there is no more distance, only the most intimate of battles between two people who were never meant to meet.

For contact details and to find out more about the Psy-Changeling series, please visit her website. </p>A love triangle long awaited by fans resolves in Singh's 10th Psy-Changeling installment, the first in hardcover. Sienna Lauren is a rare Psy X who can wreak devastation with cold fire. Sienna has fought hard to control her abilities, knowing she'll most likely burn out and die by age 25, but she can't control her longing for alpha wolf Hawke. Hawke is drawn to her too, but there are barriers between them: age, station, and the death of his destined mate. Hawke and Sienna's fight against their fierce attraction parallels the beginnings of real war against antichangeling Psy factions&#x2014;a war in which Sienna may have to use the powers that could destroy her. Singh deftly eliminates Sienna's potential love interest and adds a sweet secondary romance that contrasts with the violent intensity of Sienna and Hawke's relationship.

He was the author of several award-winning books, including the <i>Encyclopedia of American Intelligence and Espionage</i>; <i>Honorable Treachery</i>, <i>The Spanish War</i>, which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist; and the novels <i>The Cosgrove Report</i> and <i>An Agent on the Other Side</i>.O'Toole, a former intelligence officer, presents a comprehensive history of American intelligence activities from colonial times to the present. While Americans profess to believe, with Secretary of State Henry Stimson, that "gentlemen do not read other people's mail," they in fact have proven quite skilled in all manner of espionage and covert action. George Washington himself was the most gifted intelligence officer of the Revolution; he recruited, trained, dispatched, and handsomely rewarded spies. In 1917 another Virginian, President Woodrow Wilson, created a little-known secret agency, the Inquiry, directed by journalist Walter Lippmann, to compile intelligence for the peace negotiations that ended World War I. O'Toole offers fascinating information generally unrecorded in traditional diplomatic and military histories. Recommended for academic and large public libraries. O'Toole is also the author of The Encyclopedia of American Intelligence and Espionage: From the Revolutionary War to the Present, LJ 1/89.<br><i>- Thomas H.

Wright (a contributor to Esquire, Sports Afield, Field and Stream, etc.) realizes a 20-year dream of fishing the Neversink River when he rents a 250-acre estate with one mile of the river flowing through it. (Running through a high Catskill Mountains valley, the Neversink is one of the finest eastern trout streams.) After his first excited forays, Wright begins improving his stream by stocking hatchery-raised brown trout, but he soon discovers that tank-raised fish have had shyness, territoriality, and all survival traits bred out of them. Worse, they are disgustingly easy to catch, rising to almost any fly-- particularly those that resemble Purina fish pellets. Wright's experiments quickly become more sophisticated, beginning with ordering eggs of exotic trout subspecies from Alaska and planting them in the freezing December river. Along the way, Wright describes the initial exploitation of the Neversink as a private resource by a wealthy New Yorker who bought a hotel on its banks and claimed riparian rights. Native sons of the Neversink Valley furiously resented being shut off from their river and redoubled their fishing, although high-powered lawyers imported from New York brought them to heel. Wright, who eventually bought ``my water,'' avers that the present-day locals feel no resentment for the summer people. He does catch the occasional poacher: One 18- year-old compounded his trespass by fishing with a worm and was turned into the local authorities ``for processing.'' Although the year-round residents lack ``color and charm,'' there have been many notable visitors, including Theodore Gordon, who launched dry-fly fishing in America in 1890. Sadly, the underprivileged Gordon ``never owned any water'' and actually preferred ``public to private fisheries.'' Highly informative on the natural history of brook trout, the eternally evolving life of the trout stream, and the tiny world of top-drawer troutists. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Wright's "intense exploration" of his home stream in New York State's Catskill Mountains yields a scientific and literary angling book that is placed firmly in the tradition of the 19th-century bon amateur. Wright's quest is for more and bigger Salvelinus fontinalis, the distinctly North American char, in the water he first rents, then owns, on the Neversink, arguably the "First River" of American flyfishing. The gentle diary-like tone of his report belies an angling passion that propels Wright from observation of small details made while fishing into wider inquiry that calls upon 20 years of experiments in stream improvements, stocking and feeding. Like Wright's recent how-to books (especially the underrated Superior Flies ), this account offers up odd angling epiphanies in an urbane writing style. In Wright's case, familiarity with a river breeds endless wonder. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Interior Views: Design at Its Best</h2><p>Interior Views: Design at Its Best (A Studio book)</p><p></p><h2>� C�mo el Grinch rob� la Navidad !

It is a story of the beginning of domesticated life: Man meets Woman and they move into a cave and set up the first household. Dog, Horse, and Cow come out of the Wild Woods and become tame. But Cat refuses, &#x201c;I am not a friend and I am not a servant. I am the Cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me.&#x201d; Woman makes a bargain with Cat to allow him to come into the cave and sit by the fire and drink milk. But when night comes, he is once again the Cat that walks by himself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contrast between the cozy, domestic world and the cold, dark outdoors where the cat still has his freedom make this a compelling tale and a fun take on the independent feline character.

Fortunately for the jack-of-few-trades man (or woman), courage--and the knowledge it's based on--can now be gleaned from the author's literate, lucid, and witty guide to home building and repair. Owen's own house, a Connecticut Colonial built around 1790, serves as his model. Needing to repaint the house, for instance, he sets off to find the ultimate paint, winding up at the firm of Keeler &amp; Long, which makes paint for nuclear power plants (``It would probably be expensive,'' muses Owen, ``but it would last practically forever. Using it might even turn out to be a pretty good move, in the event of nuclear war''). There, he learns much about paint--including that the firm's epoxy-based product won't do for him (``epoxies [tend] to deteriorate in sunlight,'' warns proprietor Henry Long)--and passes that information on here, along with his own know-how on the history, nature, and uses and abuses of paints: We learn, for example, the pros and cons of latex paint, the best ways to keep paint from peeling off a house, and, in the sort of unexpected detail that livens every page, the trouble with letting a cow near a freshly oil-painted house--it will lick the paint, which contains flaxseed. Fascinating explorations of walls, roofs, kitchens, bathrooms, electricity, lumber (and its enemies: the stethoscope from a kid's toy medical bag is useful, Owen tells us, for detecting the munching of carpenter ants) follow, and come together in a detailed description of how, using power-tools, he adapted an extra bedroom into a custom-built study. Owen transforms even the repair of a leaking hot-water pipe into an enticing adventure: his congenial guidance will likely enthrall those who enjoy home repair--and, marvelously, many who don't.

His prose is eloquent and evocative, and possesses that priceless commodity: authenticity. . . . His success is undeniably romantic, and all the better for it." &#x2014;<i>The Guardian (UK)</i><br><br>"[A] captivating book . . . a keenly observed account of the vocation handed down to Mr. Rebanks from his father and grandfather and their ancestors before them, and the seasonal rhythms and rituals that define life on a farm." &#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"I never imagined&nbsp;I'd be absorbed by a book about sheep.

The entire structure of what was arguably the most profitable colony in the world rested on the labour of half a million slaves. In 1791 the waves of unrest inspired by the French Revolution reached across the Atlantic dividing the loyalties of the white population of the island. The brutally treated slaves of Saint Domingo seized at this confusion and rose up in rebellion against masters. In thisclassic work, CLR James chronicles the only successful slave revolt in history and provides a critical portrait of their leader, Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, &#39;one of the most remarkable men of a period rich in remarkable men&#39;.</p><p>In 1789 the French colony of Saint Domingue was the most profitable real estate in the world. These profits came at a price: while its sugar plantations supplied two-thirds of France's overseas trade, they also stimulated the greatest individual market for the slave trade. The slaves were brutally treated and died in great numbers, prompting a never-ending influx of new slaves.<p> The French Revolution sent waves all the way across the Atlantic, dividing the colony's white population in 1791. The elites remained royalist, while the bourgeoisie embraced the revolutionary ideals. The slaves seized the moment and in the confusion rebelled en masse against their owners. The Haitian Slave Revolt had begun. When it ended in 1803, Saint Domingue had become Haiti, the first independent nation in the Caribbean.</p><p> C.L.R. James tells the story of the revolt and the events leading up to it in his masterpiece, <i>The Black Jacobins</i>. James's personal beliefs infuse his narrative: in his preface to a 1962 edition of the book, he asserts that , when written in 1938, it was "intended to stimulate the coming emancipation of Africa." James writes passionately about the horrific lives of the slaves and of the man who rose up and led them--a semiliterate slave named Fran�ois-Dominique Toussaint L'Ouverture. As James notes, however, "Toussaint did not make the revolution. It was the revolution that made Toussaint." </p><p> With its appendix, "From Toussaint L'Ouverture to Fidel Castro," <i>The Black Jacobins</i> provides an excellent window into the Haitian Revolution and the worldwide repercussions it caused. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>&#34;Detailed, richly documented and dramatically written.&#34;--The New York Times</p><h2>65 Short Stories (Complete and Unabridged)</h2><p>65 Short Stories (Complete and Unabridged)</p><p></p><h2>The Prisoner in His Palace: Saddam Hussein, His American Guards, and What History Leaves Unsaid</h2><p>In the haunting tradition of <i>In Cold Blood</i> and <i>The Executioner&#x2019;s Song</i>, this remarkably insightful and surprisingly intimate portrait of Saddam Hussein lifts away the top layer of a dictator&#x2019;s evil and finds complexity beneath as it invites us to take a journey with twelve young American soldiers in the summer of 2006. Trained to aggressively confront the enemy in combat, the men learn, shortly after being deployed to Iraq, that fate has assigned them a different role. It becomes their job to guard the country&#x2019;s notorious leader in the months leading to his execution.<br><br>Living alongside, and caring for, their &#x201c;high value detainee&#x201d; in a former palace dubbed The Rock and regularly transporting him to his raucous trial, many of the men begin questioning some of their most basic assumptions&#x2014;about the judicial process, Saddam&#x2019;s character, and the morality of modern war. Although the young soldiers&#x2019; increasingly intimate conversations with the once-feared dictator never lead them to doubt his responsibility for unspeakable crimes, the men do discover surprising new layers to his psyche that run counter to the media&#x2019;s portrayal of him.<br> <br>Woven from first-hand accounts provided by many of the American guards, government officials, interrogators, scholars, spies, lawyers, family members, and victims, <i>The Prisoner in His Palace</i> shows two Saddams coexisting in one person: the defiant tyrant who uses torture and murder as tools, and a shrewd but contemplative prisoner who exhibits surprising affection, dignity, and courage in the face of looming death.<br> <br>In this artfully constructed narrative, Saddam, the &#x201c;man without a conscience,&#x201d; gets many of those around him to examine theirs. Wonderfully thought-provoking, <i>The Prisoner in His Palace</i> reveals what it is like to discover in one&#x2019;s ruthless enemy a man, and then deliver him to the gallows.</p><p>Will Bardenwerper has contributed to&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>.

His head was pounding, his mouth sandpaper. He was staying at his cousin&#x2019;s house, and his large frame was draped across the couch. It felt like it had only been a few hours since he&#x2019;d passed out there after getting home from a long night working security at the Midnight Rodeo, a rough honky-tonk bar in the central Florida town of Ocala. He blamed the nasty headache on the beers he&#x2019;d torn through after his shift ended around 4:00 a.m. Though he tried to ignore it, his phone kept ringing, each series of tones sending searing pain through his hungover skull. Too sapped of energy to hold the phone to his ear, he put it on speaker and clumsily dropped it to the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Turn on the TV,&#x201d; a voice urged. It was his cousin&#x2019;s wife, calling from work, and she sounded panicked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which channel?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Any of them,&#x201d; she replied.<br> <br>It was just after 9:00 a.m. on September 11, 2001. Hutchinson turned on the television just in time to see United Airlines Flight 175 strike the South Tower of the World Trade Center, not quite twenty minutes after American Airlines Flight 11 had slammed into the North Tower.<br> <br>Until that morning he&#x2019;d been on an uncertain career path. A muscular former Georgia high school football and baseball standout, he&#x2019;d been working for the county road department during the day and doing some bouncing at the Rodeo at night, but the images of a smoldering lower Manhattan decided something in him. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t getting over there fast enough,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d later say, referring to his decision to join the Army and go overseas.<br> Baghdad, Iraq&#x2014;August 2006<p></p> <br>Five years later, Steve Hutchinson, known as Hutch to his buddies, was doing the &#x201c;duffel bag drag&#x201d; across the steamy tarmac of Baghdad International Airport, often referred to as BIAP. He&#x2019;d arrived as part of the 551st Military Police Company based out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and he knew the drill. Like many who joined the military in the wake of the September 11 attacks, he&#x2019;d found himself thrust into an exhausting operational tempo. By 2006, he&#x2019;d already spent a year deployed to Iraq during the initial invasion in 2003, and another in Afghanistan. He was one of the more tenured members of his squad of eleven other American military policemen, mostly in their twenties, who&#x2019;d just arrived &#x201c;downrange.&#x201d; The youngest, Private Tucker Dawson, wasn&#x2019;t yet twenty-one; the oldest, Specialist Art Perkins, was in his mid-thirties. With the &#x201c;War on Terror&#x201d; already nearly five years old, about half had deployed previously while the other half had spilled from the Air Force C-130 into a combat zone for the first time. The lieutenant to whom they reported, Andre Jackson, was a recent ROTC graduate. The junior enlisted soldiers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) under his command came from all over the United States, though a disproportionate number hailed from working-class communities scattered across the Rust Belt.<br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t know it yet, but in a few months they&#x2019;d be playing a pivotal role in a historical drama they couldn&#x2019;t have imagined.<br> <br>The men&#x2014;there were no women in the squad&#x2014;had grown reasonably tight in the months preceding deployment. They&#x2019;d performed countless training missions back at Fort Campbell to prepare for deployment, which they expected would be spent carrying out assignments common for military policemen&#x2014;for example, guarding detainees and providing convoy security. And during the training lulls those who were single grabbed some downtime at Kickers bar or the Lodge in nearby Clarksville, Tennessee, while the married among them stuck with more domesticated routines, such as taking turns babysitting each other&#x2019;s kids so that they could enjoy dinner with their wives at the popular Yamato&#x2019;s Japanese steakhouse off post.<br> <br>Those who&#x2019;d deployed before, like Hutchinson, Art Perkins, Tom Flanagan, and Chris Tasker, were familiar with the routine. Less so Tucker Dawson, Adam Rogerson, and Paul Sphar, for whom this was an altogether new adventure. Sphar had barely been allowed to deploy at all, due to his persistent weight problems. In the months leading up to their leaving for Iraq, Sergeant Chris Battaglia had &#x201c;run the dogshit&#x201d; out of Sphar to trim his ample midsection. The young private stood out from the others for reasons other than his weight, though. The fact was, he seemed a better match for a skate park or mosh pit than a military parade ground. He was covered in tattoos, proud to have almost a &#x201c;full shirt&#x201d; of them.<br> <br>The soldiers had arrived in Iraq after a marathon journey that took them from Fort Campbell to Maine to Germany to Kuwait to&#x2014;at last&#x2014;BIAP&#x2019;s floodlit tarmac. The temperatures had continued to linger in the nineties even after the sun had set, and before the men had even finished unloading their bags, their clothes were drenched in sweat. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that they were far from home, and that this was for real.</p><h2>Your Erroneous Zones</h2><p><p><strong>THE RECORD-BREAKING, #1 <em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER &#x2013; OVER 35 MILLION COPIES SOLD</strong></p><p><strong>The first book by Wayne Dyer, author of the multimillion-copy bestseller <em>Pulling Your Own Strings </em>and national bestsellers <em>There&#x2019;s a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem</em> and <em>Wisdom of the Ages,</em> a positive and practical guide to breaking free from the trap of negative thinking and enjoying life to the fullest.</strong></p><p>If you're plagued by guilt or worry and find yourself unwittingly falling into the same old self-destructive patterns, then you have "erroneous zones" &#x2013; whole facets of your approach to life that act as barriers to your success and happiness. </p><p>Perhaps you believe that you have no control over your feelings and reactions &#x2013; Dyer shows how you can take charge of yourself and manage how much you will let difficult times and people affect you.

But behind her captivating fa�ade lay a closely-guarded secret. </p><p> Suzanne was born into poverty in rural France, before her mother fled the provinces, taking her to Montmartre. There, as a teenager Suzanne began posing for&#x2015;and having affairs with&#x2015;some of the age&#x2019;s most renowned painters. Then Renoir caught her indulging in a passion she had been trying to conceal: the model was herself a talented artist. </p><p> Some found her vibrant still lifes and frank portraits as shocking as her bohemian lifestyle. At eighteen, she gave birth to an illegitimate child, future painter Maurice Utrillo. But her friends Toulouse-Lautrec and Degas could see her skill. Rebellious and opinionated, she refused to be confined by tradition or gender, and in 1894, her work was accepted to the Salon de la Soci�t� Nationale des Beaux-Arts, an extraordinary achievement for a working-class woman with no formal art training. </p><p> <i>Renoir&#x2019;s Dancer</i> tells the remarkable tale of an ambitious, headstrong woman fighting to find a professional voice in a male-dominated world.</p></p><p>CATHERINE HEWITT studied French Literature and Art History at Royal Holloway, University of London and the Courtauld Institute of Art.

She lives in a village in Surrey.<p>&#x201c;Valadon provides Hewitt with a glorious cast, including Renoir, van Gogh, Toulouse-Laurtrec, and Degas . . . Hewitt&#x2019;s straight-ahead telling of Valadon&#x2019;s dramatic, many-faceted story captures this artist of &#x2018;honesty and passion,&#x2019; this &#x2018;matriarch of creative rebellion,&#x2019; with precision, narrative drive, and low-key awe.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><br><b></b><br>&#x201c;Suzanne Valadon may not be a name most people mention when they discuss great artists.

Howard&#39;s Conan the Barbarian exploded on to the comics scene. Writer Roy Thomas teamed with a young artist named Barry Smith, and together the two mapped out some of the most stirring and memorable Conan adventures to come along since those written by Howard himself. Over the course of their 24-issue run together, Thomas and Smith defined Conan for a generation of comics readers, and now those stories are collected here in a series of trade paperbacks. Featuring completely remastered color and text corrections, and containing material not available for nearly thirty years, these books are the perfect companions to the upcoming all-new Conan series from Dark Horse.</p><p><b>Roy Thomas </b>is a comic book writer and editor. He is a former editor in chief of Marvel Comics. He is known for his work on <i>Conan the Barbarian, The Avengers, X-Men, </i>and a number of other beloved titles.<br><br><b>Barry Windsor-Smith </b>is a comic book writer, illustrator, and painter. He was educated at East Ham Technical College and later went on to write for Marvel, DC, Valiant, Dark Horse, and other comic book imprints. Windsor-Smith is best known for his work on <i>Avengers, Iron Man, Conan the Barbarian, </i>and<i>&nbsp;Red Sonja. </i>He is a member of the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.These reprints from Marvel's Conan the Barbarian (originally published in the early 1970s) shows the best and worst of sword and sorcery adventure. At its best, S&amp;S fiction enables readers to identify with heroes who fight against vast, cosmic forces. At its worst, it features muscle-bound louts in fur skivvies who bellow insults at each other while waving enormous, phallic weapons. Robert E. Howard, who created Conan in a series of pulp magazine tales, achieved the former level more often than he sank to the latter. Eventually, Thomas and Windsor-Smith did, too. Thomas's informative closing notes explain how, under Stan Lee's editorship, he got permission to write a Conan comic in collaboration with young artist Windsor-Smith. He admits to glitches in the writing and blemishes in the art, but correctly states that the comic hit its stride by issue #4, an adaptation of Howard's "Tower of the Elephant." This archetypal Conan story sets the quick-thinking, tough outsider against a corrupt, over-sophisticated society. The young barbarian is exasperated by the superior attitudes of the experienced rogues in the slums of a decadent metropolis, so he decides to test himself by robbing a powerful, evil sorcerer. This comics adaptation isn't without flaws, but Thomas does preserve Howard's escalating sense of menace and strangeness. Windsor-Smith's pencils do justice to the mood too, making Conan believably muscular enough to prevail against human or superhuman foes. The stories in this deluxe collection are much more spirited and solid than those featured in the original printing. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But when a deadly sickness suddenly appears among the people of Corona, Pony must undertake a pilgrimage that will test her powers&#x2013;and her faith&#x2013;as never before. Watching her every step of the way is the man she hates above all else: Marcalo De&#x2019;Unnero, the villain responsible for Elbryan&#x2019;s death . . . who would desire nothing more than to lead Pony down that same treacherous path to destruction.<br></p><p>Setting aside his wildly popular Forgotten Realms books for the moment, Bob Salvatore continues to wade into his character-development-heavy Demon Wars saga with this meaty kickoff to the latest DW series. If you're familiar with the series (and if you're not, start with <i>The Demon Awakens</i>), you know that this ain't Icewind Dale. The generously developed characters take center stage, and they--much to our initial dismay, perhaps--are far from invincible. (More than a few hearts were broken when Elbryan the Nightbird, Touel'alfar-trained ranger extraordinaire, bit the dust in the last book, <i>Demon Apostle</i>.)<p> <i>Mortalis</i> shifts the spotlight to fearsome gemstone-wielder Jilseponie (a.k.a. Pony), who's got to decide just what path to take in the wake of Markwart/Bestesbulzibar's defeat and the death of her beloved ranger hubby. Should she take over the Abellican church as Mother Abbess? Or should she take King Danube's offer to be Baroness of Palmaris? Or perhaps her grief-tinged destiny lies along another path. Countless goblins still require a firm beating down, the ranks of the Abellicans are far from content, and a virulent plague threatens to kill off even more characters.

Westlake, a.k.a. Richard Stark, ended his legendary series of books about a career criminal known only as Parker with 1974's <i>Butcher's Moon</i>. He cited too much competition from copycats in print, on film, and on television. Persuaded by fans and family, Westlake has resurrected Parker with a welcome burst of energy and imagination. The felon and his long-time lady friend Claire are enjoying the quiet life in their New Jersey lakeside home when Parker's invited to become part of a plan to remove a large sum of cash from a glossy TV-preacher named William Archibald. It's a heist that goes wrong from the start and turns into a tense, chaotic ballet of betrayal and death. One of Parker's partners is a weak babbler, another a cold traitor. Archibald's security chief is a tenacious pursuer, intent on retrieving his employer's money. Along the way, we learn how to hide crooks, cars, and cash in a small city with an efficient police force; how to escape from a variety of traps and sealed rooms; and most of all how Parker has managed to stay alive--in readers' minds as well as in the brain of his creator--for all these years.Richard Stark, aka Donald E. Westlake (1933&#x2013;2008), wrote dozens of novels under his own name and a rainbow of other pseudonyms.

His name was Alton Turner Blackwood, and in the space of a few months he brutally murdered four families. His savage spree ended only when he himself was killed by the last survivor of the last family, a fourteen-year-old boy.<br><br> Half a continent away and two decades later, someone is murdering families again, recreating <br> in detail Blackwood&#x2019;s crimes. Homicide detective John Calvino is certain that his own family&#x2014;his wife and three children&#x2014;will be targets in the fourth crime, just as his parents and sisters were victims on that distant night when he was fourteen and killed their slayer.<br><br> As a detective, John is a man of reason who deals in cold facts. But an extraordinary experience convinces him that sometimes death is not a one-way journey, that sometimes the dead return.<br><br> Here is ghost story like no other you have read. In the Calvinos, Dean Koontz brings to life a family that might be your own, in a war for their survival against an adversary more malevolent than any he has yet created, with their own home the battleground. Of all his acclaimed novels, none exceeds <i>What the Night Knows</i> in power, in chilling suspense, and in sheer mesmerizing storytelling.</p><p><b>A Letter from Author Dean Koontz</b> <br> <p></p> <b>Let's Call It "The Turn of the Phillips-Head Screw"</b><br> I was happily working on a novel titled <i>What the Night Knows</i>, the premise of which was already described on various web-site postings, when an idea for a ghost story slammed into me with as much force as an exuberant 60-pound golden retriever playing bowl-dad-off-his-feet. When I picked myself up from my office floor, I didn't need a sticky roller to remove the dog hair from my clothes, but the story I had been working on was entirely Swiffered out of my head to make room for the ghost story. After alerting my editor and my publisher of my intentions, I put aside <i>What the Night Knows</i> and set to work enthusiastically on the new idea. <p></p> Over the next few months, as the manuscript pages piled up, I occasionally sent lists of possible titles to my editor and my publisher, and they sent lists of titles to me. None of us liked the same title. We didn't argue. We just quietly declined to be enthusiastic about one another's suggestions. We are a genteel bunch. The only one of us to wake with the severed head of a horse in his bed was me, and that was unrelated to the disagreement about titles. I'm not even sure who sent the horse's head, although I did fail to renew my subscription to <i>Oprah</i> magazine, and their circulation department does play hardball. <p></p> Anyway, one day, when I was deep into the still untitled ghost story, I suddenly realized that the title of the novel I had set aside, <i>What the Night Knows</i>, would be a perfect title for the novel I was writing. In fact, it was more suited to the ghost story than to the novel to which it had been previously attached. I emailed my publisher suggesting that I steal this title from myself, and as I sent that email, I simultaneously received one from her--which made the same suggestion. This seemed like destiny at work, and if not destiny, then something even stranger, something with which a wise person would not screw around. <p></p> Now, the ghost story, <i>What the Night Knows</i>, is scheduled to land in bookstores on 28 December, and the book I set aside--but to which I will return--doesn't have a title. So here we go again. Sometimes I think that life is nothing but a never-ending series of problems and crises, a dark journey of frustration and anxiety and despair, and I really just want to hijack a gasoline tanker truck and drive it at high speed over a cliff. But then I eat a couple of Reese's peanut-butter cups, and everything's swell again. <p></p>Dean Koontz is the author of many #1 New York Times bestsellers.

He is lovingly called the Watermaster, and he believes that the water should be a free gift to all.</p><p>But when the Watermaster goes on an unexpected journey, the people realize in a whole new way the amazing gift he's been giving them. The only gift they really need.</p><p>God's grace is a gift more precious than water in a desert. It is all you and your children ever need. As our bodies cannot live without water, so our souls cannot truly live without God's grace. It is by His grace alone that we can come to Him and ask for the Living Water, which is eternal life. His grace poured out at Calvary cleanses our hearts and souls.

Coming Out Under Fire is an invaluable contribution not only to gay history, but also to an aspect of our military history that is often ignored yet still affects thousands of GIs and veterans.</p><p>Berube uses documents and interviews with gay veterans to explain how the military purged servicemen and -women on the basis of homosexuality during WW II and how these policies were publicly challenged later by military psychiatrists.

Beautiful Jim Key, the onetime ugly duckling of a scrub colt that became one of the most heralded and beloved heroes of his day, was famous neither for his beauty nor his speed but instead for his exceptional intelligence. Said to have an I.Q. equivalent to that of a human sixth-grader, Jim exploded on to the national scene in 1897 by demonstrating inexplicable abilities to read, write, spell, do mathematics, tell time, sort mail, cite biblical passages, and debate politics.</p><p>For the next nine years, Jim performed in nationwide expositions and world's fairs to wildly receptive crowds, smashing box-office records, overcoming hurdles of prejudice and skepticism, all the while winning rapturous praise from the press and leaders such as President McKinley, Booker T. Washington, and Alice Roosevelt Longworth.</p><p>In this breathtaking saga, Jim's astonishing journey is coupled with that of his trainer and best friend, Dr. William Key, a self-taught veterinarian, former slave, Civil War veteran, prominent African-American entrepreneur, and one of the most renowned horse whisperers of his time -- a man who shunned all force in the training of horses, instead relying on kindness and patience.</p><p>Masterful storyteller and bestselling author Mim Eichler Rivas at long last gives two cultural icons their due, not only unraveling the mystery of their disappearance but examining how, thanks to the rare and intimate relationship between horse and man that was championed by promoter and humane activist Albert R. Rogers, a dramatic shift took place in the public mind that made kindness to animals a cornerstone of modern civilization and helped launch the animal rights movement. Unveiled against the backdrop of American history, <strong>Beautiful Jim Key</strong> is their incredible tale.</p></p><p>An inspirational tale that was nearly buried beneath the detritus of time (namely floods and fires), <i>Beautiful Jim Key</i> recalls the remarkable life of a remarkable horse at the turn of the previous century. Revered not for his speed on the track, Beautiful Jim Key was instead a cerebral celebrity who electrified fairgoers from St. Louis to Boston with apparent feats of mathematics, reading, and writing, even making change for a dollar. But as might be expected, author Mim Eichler Rivas's story is about much more than a horse from Tennessee imbued with a staggering intellect. It's also about Jim Key's equally remarkable trainer, Dr. William Key, a black man and onetime slave who narrowly survived the American Civil War, prospered against all odds, and emerged as a wealthy inventor, self-trained veterinarian, and community pillar. Dr. Key's use of kindness and patience to train Jim, rather than the de rigueur tactics of beatings and intimidation, gave way to fresh thinking about animal husbandry at a time when animals were considered virtually inanimate. And then some: "The horse and the man from Tennessee had not only helped pioneer the humane movement but had, over the past seven years, in direct and indirect ways, changed the face of popular entertainment. [Suddenly], the big-budgeted theatrical productions began adding nonhuman cast members to their shows." The author provides ample scene-setting color, especially when describing the various exhibitions Jim Key headlined, and does a reasonably good job of footnoting her various claims about Jim's mental prowess, though occasionally the reader wonders how, exactly, she decoded the horse's thought process. Her writing style is also somewhat tepid, but still, there is no doubt that Jim Key was an exceptional horse in an exceptional era guided by an exceptional man. Thanks to Rivas, Seabiscuit must now share a posthumous marquee along with Beautiful Jim Key. <i>--Kim Hughes</i><p>Mim Eichler Rivas is the author of the acclaimed <em>Beautiful Jim Key</em>, as well as the coauthor of more than eighteen books, including <em>The Pursuit of Happyness</em> and <em>Finding Fish with Antwone Fisher</em>.</p></p><h2>Devotions for a Deeper Life: A Daily Devotional</h2><p>Few have understood the nature of sanctification, or the nature of God, better than Oswald Chambers.

But suddenly, retired marine sergeant Ray Cruz, whom we met in Hunter&#x2019;s last bestseller, Dead Zero, is in the middle of the softest target of all, a huge emporium outside Minneapolis where a self-styled ";Mumbai Brigade"; has come to bring massive death to the heartland. Hunter flashes over the events as if in real time: the assembly of the killer team composed of terrorists from one of the world&#x2019;s hellholes, but led by a nihilistic insider who knows the mall backwards and forwards and has taken over the security software as well as the vast building and 1,000 hostages; the politics of SWAT as officials argue over tactics o</p><p>Stephen Hunter has written over twenty novels.

What makes talented, intelligent young men volunteer for physical punishment, cold water, and days without sleep? Why is the price of admission to this unique warrior culture so steep? In <b>The Warrior Elite,</b><i> </i>former Navy SEAL Dick Couch documents the process that transforms young men into warriors. SEAL training is the longest, toughest, most relentless military training in the free world. It is the distillation of the human spirit, a tradition-bound ordeal that seeks to find men of character and courage, men with a burning desire to win at all costs, men who would rather die than quit.<br><br>The book follows the trainees of Class 228 as they struggle through the twenty-seven-week Basic Underwater Demolition/Seal (BUD/S) training course at the Navy Special Warfare Training Center in Coronado, California. Only one in five will be left standing at the end of this brutal ordeal, a rite of passage that is but one step in the long road to becoming a SEAL. Few men have the character or stamina that allows them to keep going while others give in to the pain and the cold. <b>The Warrior Elite </b>reveals who these men are, where they come from, and what makes them so special.</p><p>"The Warrior Elite is the first book that captures how the SEAL spirit is tempered.

This collection of Bonald&#39;s essays, translated by Christopher Blum, will introduce readers to Bonald&#39;s thought with respect to the key areas of Catholic Social Teaching.</p><p>Louis de Bonald (1754-1840) was, in the words of Lamartine, &#34;the most noble and pure face that the Old Regime was able to turn towards the New.&#34; Farmer and statesman, paterfamilias and publicist, Bonald is know for his spirited defense of the Christian social order from the rostrum of the French Chamber of Deputies under the Bourbon Restoration and in his many essays and books, especially his &#34;Theory of Political and Religious Power&#34; (1796) and &#34;On Divorce&#34; (1801).&#34;Bonald&#39;s message is one that deserves our attention.

After his father was brutally murdered, Frederick left the South and worked as a waiter in Chicago and Brooklyn. Seeking greater freedom, he traveled to London, then crisscrossed Europe, and in a highly unusual choice for a black American at the time went to Russia.<br><br>Because he found no color line there, Frederick settled in Moscow, becoming a rich and famous owner of variety theaters and restaurants. When the Bolshevik Revolution ruined him, he barely escaped to Constantinople, where he made another fortune by opening celebrated nightclubs as the "Sultan of Jazz." However, the long arm of American racism, the xenophobia of the new Turkish Republic, and Frederick&#x2019;s own extravagance landed him in debtor&#x2019;s prison.

An expert in propaganda and media, he teaches at New York University.In these provocative essays, Miller, associate professor in the writing seminars at Johns Hopkins University, brilliantly employs the techniques of New Criticism to "read" TV commercials, game shows and the news, in order to expose television's pernicious effect on American life and culture. Miller persuasively argues that TV advertising sponsors seek to reduce viewers to a state of semi-hypnotized consumerism, and that qualities that might threaten this condition, such as individuality and critical awareness, are discouraged by everything on the tube. For example, Miller not only describes with devastating wit the game show Family Feud 's, stupidities and its host Richard Dawson's "oleaginous noblesse oblige," he also proves that by rewarding contestants for giving the most common answer of 100 people surveyed, the show celebrates not family identity but the sameness of consumer households that advertising has helped to create. Even the news is governed by a desire to sell the viewer. The author's analysis of the 1984 Democratic primary news coverage demonstrates that TV journalists strive not to "inform the public," but "to tell the public what the newsmen think the public is already thinking." A handful of essays on rock music and film, while interesting, seem out of place in this collection devoted primarily to TV, and occasionally Miller's acerbic blows are below the belt.

Russell: The Life and Legend of America&#39;s Cowboy Artist</h2><p>A fascinating biography brings to life the man behind the cowboy artist--a wrangler during the glory years of the open range and the lover of a fiery woman half his age--and his rise to fame with the help of the robber barons he despised.</p><p><p><strong>John Taliaferro </strong>is an independent historian and former senior editor for <em>Newsweek</em> and <em>Texas Monthly.</em></p>When he left St. Louis to rusticate in Montana in 1880, Russell was only 16 years old and entranced by a West whose archetypes were then jelling into the stereotypes familiar to us today. With a gregarious sense of adventure and budding artistic talent, he stayed there for a lifetime, which, surprisingly enough, is here first given the cradle-to-grave treatment. A debut author, Taliaferro writes like a veteran, going beyond chronicle to plumb his subject's inner, emotional life, embedded in the atmosphere of his times. Montana in the 1880s, though no longer a frontier, was plenty wild, and Taliaferro engagingly relates Russell's ventures to experience the figures in his imagination: cowboys and Indians, buffalo and bears. An easy maker of friends (with the cowboys), he met them, camped and drank with them, and put them down first as doodles, eventually as paintings. A better boon companion than savvy art marketeer, Russell didn't taste success until his marriage to a possessive woman his chums resentfully called the "little robber," but Nancy gave Charlie the necessary push out of the saloons and into the galleries. Whatever Russell's status in art history--detractors debunk his work for sentimentalism; enthusiasts value its evocative panoramas--his companionable character is seamlessly restored by Taliaferro. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The Last Judgement (Art History Mystery)</h2><p>Hired to deliver a painting from a Parisian art dealer to a client in Rome, British art historian and amateur sleuth Jonathan Argyll suddenly finds himself caught up in a double murder and begins a probe that uncovers a secret hidden since World War II.

Simultaneous.</p><p>A loyal member of Hitler's Jungm&#x201e;del has some choices to make when she discovers that her parents are hiding a Jewish family. Having uncritically accepted the pervading anti-Semitism and faithfully parroted its slogans, Korinna, 11, is horrified when her wardrobe swings back to reveal Sophie Krugmann and Rachel, her 5-year-old daughter, in a secret room. Does Korinna believe in the party line strongly enough to turn in her own mother and father? In the agony of indecision, Korinna skips school, loses sleep, and arouses the suspicions of her best friend, Rita, whose brother is a Gestapo agent; meanwhile, reluctantly succumbing to Rachel's charms and thinking about how Jews and anyone who associates with them are being brutalized, her attitudes begin to change. Williams (The Long Silk Strand, 1995, etc.) has her young characters obediently repeating patriotic Nazi slogans and promises, but presents counterarguments more subtly, by simply showing the Gestapo's cruelty, Sophie's bitterness and exhaustion, Rachel's fear, and the general climate of repression. In the end, Rita betrays Korinna, but then warns her of the impending raid; the Krugmanns are spirited away just in time, and Korinna's family must also go into hiding. Confusingly, Williams's suggestion in the afterword that freedom may be more important than love isn't a theme she develops in the story, but she pays stirring tribute to the courage and ingenuity some outwardly ordinary people showed in those dark days. With scattered, stiff b&amp;w illustrations. (Fiction. 10-13) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Melodrama substitutes for conflict in this heavy-handed novel set in Nazi Germany. At 13, Korinna Rehme is just like the other members of her girls' youth group: besotted with the Fuhrer ("Hitler is the most wonderful man, Mother. Don't you think so?") and rabidly anti-Semitic. When she discovers that two Jews, a mother and young daughter, are hiding in her very own house, she is horrified at her parents' calumny. As Korinna weighs the possibility of turning her parents in, her best friend, Rita, begins to grow suspicious and starts laying a deadly trap for the Rehmes and their clandestine guests. Neither subtlety nor insight plays a part in these proceedings: Williams doesn't suggest the attractions of the Hitler youth groups or allow for the range of attitudes within these groups, described so persuasively in such memoirs as Ilse Koehn's Mischling, Second Degree or Hans Peter Richter's I Was There. Instead, the dilemmas faced by these characters come across to the reader as crystal-clear choices between good and evil. This type of simplification makes for bad history?and a flat read.

How these practices could ever have been advocated is only part of the puzzle presented in this lively biography.

A subplot features the hapless Arnold, who becomes separated from the group with only Ms. Frizzle's talking radio for company. He survives several harrowing adventures before the magic school bus/plane picks him up.

When her bus transforms itself into a hot-air balloon (and later into a weather plane) to take a close look at "one of the world's hurricane breeding grounds," the kids, especially Arnold, realize this won't be an ordinary lesson in meteorology. As is usual in the Magic School Bus series, Cole presents the science in easy-to-understand terms, with Degen clarifying the concepts and adding comic relief through double-page-spread pictures that brim with details.

Poor thing, she&#x2019;s the one who faced down the robber and had to empty the cash register for the crook,&#x201d; replied the police chief.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did the robber take a lot of money?&#x201d; asked Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s so strange. On all three occasions, there&#x2019;s been an unusual amount of cash here in the caf�. The first time, the caf� had extra cash on hand to buy a new coffee machine. The second time, the rent was due. Just before the latest incident yesterday, a busload of soccer players stopped in after a game. The bakery sold out of all the cakes, muffins, and pastries, and that&#x2019;s why there was so much cash in the register.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That means the robber has gotten away with loads of money all three times.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very strange,&#x201d; agreed Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lucky coincidence. Do you think the robber knows when there&#x2019;s a lot of money in the register?&#x201d; asked Maya.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Excellent question, my clever detective. I&#x2019;m beginning to think that someone gives him information&#x2014;someone must tell the robber when he should raid Caf� Marzipan!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He?&#x201d; asked Maya. &#x201c;Are we sure that the robber is a man?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Another excellent question!&#x201d; replied the police chief. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t jump to conclusions, of course.The tall height Sara reported leads me to believe the robber is a man, but we won&#x2019;t be absolutely certain until we have caught the crook!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So, we either have a robber on a lucky streak, or a robber with a connection to the caf�,&#x201d; Jerry said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The police chief said nothing for a long moment. He was too busy licking frosting from his face! When he was finished, he said, &#x201c;The chances of the robber being that lucky three times in a row are low. Just think: He knows exactly when he should strike. Someone must be giving him the information he needs. Does the Whodunit Detective Agency have any ideas on who it might be?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jerry lowered his voice to a whisper: &#x201c;My guess is that it is someone who works here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why do you think that?&#x201d; asked Maya quietly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Someone outside the caf� might know that they were planning to buy a coffee machine, of course,&#x201d; answered Jerry. &#x201c;And the same person might also know when it&#x2019;s time to pay the rent. But no one outside of this shop could have predicted, first of all, that a whole soccer team was going to stop by yesterday, and second, how hungry they would be.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The police chief nodded in agreement, and Maya smiled. She realized that their little detective agency had just found a new case.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Dewey: There&#39;s a Cat in the Library!</h2><p>The story of Dewey the celebrated library cat is now available for the youngest of readers in this new, fully-illustrated picture book adventure. <br><br>When Librarian Vicki Myron finds a young kitten abandoned in the Spencer Library return box, she nurses him back to health, deciding then and there that he will be their library cat, and naming him, appropriately, Dewey Readmore Books. Dewey loves his new home, but once he discovers the littlest library visitors-who like to chase him, pull his tail, and squeeze him extra tight-Dewey begins to wonder if he's truly cut out for the demands of his new job. In the end, he is triumphant as he realizes that helping people big and small is what he is meant to do, and that by sharing his special brand of Dewey love, he can be the best library cat of all.</p><p>Vicki Myron was born on a farm fifteen miles from Spencer, Iowa. At the age of thirty-four, after a failed marriage, single motherhood, and a stint on welfare,<b> </b>she graduated summa cum laude from Mankato State University and has a masters degree from Emporia State University.<b> </b>She worked at the Spencer Public Library for twenty-five years, the last twenty as director. She lives in Spencer, Iowa.<br><br>Bret Witter is a book editor and professional writer. Raised in north Alabama, he currently lives in Louisville, Kentucky, with his wife, two children and his fourteen-year-old cat Kiki. <br><br>Steve James has always enjoyed making pictures. Steve received his BFA in illustration from Brigham Young University where he studied traditional painting techniques. He now lives in Lehi, Utah with his wife and crazy cat.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;This heartwarming picture book is based on the authors' adult title, <i>Dewey</i> (Grand Central, 2008). It describes how on a cold night Myron found a tiny kitten in the return box at Spencer Public Library in Iowa, and the feline's impact on the library community. Dewey Readmore Books overcame unpleasant encounters with young children who picked him up upside down or petted him the wrong way and settled in, "happy" to help people. The realistic illustrations, done in vibrant watercolors, bring the tale to life (the orange cat's expressions are priceless). The story moves along swiftly, and will be a hit with readers requesting animal books.&#x2014;<i>Beth Cuddy, Seward Elementary School, Auburn, NY</i> END</p><h2>The Hard Stuff (Joe the Bouncer)</h2><p>Ex-black-ops-specialist-turned-strip-club-bouncer Joe Brody has a new qualifica-tion to add to his resume: an alliance of New York City's mob bosses has deemed him its "sheriff."

But these are no typical drug-ferrying gangsters. Little Maria, the head of the Dominican mob, has discovered that her new heroin suppliers belong to an al Qaeda splinter group, and that they're planning to use their drug funds to back their terrorist agenda. With Joe in command, the mob coalition must pull off an intricate heist that will begin in Manhattan's diamond district.

Beautifully illustrated with countless pictures of guitars and the musicians who made them famous, this coffee-table edition is written by some of today&#39;s most prominent music writers, including the editor, Walter Carter, an expert on guitars; Roger H. Siminoff, author of technical guides for guitar, mandolin, and banjo construction; and country music author Michael McCall. Check out our in-depth description of this book.As Carter's subtitle says, the Gibson guitar is an American icon. From Maybelle Carter to Chuck Berry to Frank Zappa to Travis Tritt to Slash, American guitar heroes of all generations and musical styles have played Gibsons. Notable foreigners like Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Keith Richards have also enjoyed long associations with Gibsons, and the Les Paul model, named after the proto-guitar god and popularizer of the electric version of the instrument, is for many aficionados the be-all and end-all of guitars. In this profusely illustrated, large-format book, Carter and several other well-known music writers recount the history of the Gibson company, from Orville H. Gibson's days in Kalamazoo, Michigan, through the boom years and subsequent dark years of uninterested corporate ownership, and on to the new day of the present ownership, which saved the company by renewing attention to quality workmanship and love of the product. Remarkably illustrated, wonderfully detailed, this is a fitting homage to the Gibson guitar, an important document in popular music history. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>TAO of Letting Go: Meditation for Modern Living</h2><p>What is known from the <i>Tao Te Ching, I Ching, </i>and other Taoist texts is almost entirely literary. When Bruce Frantzis studied these texts with his main teacher, Grandmaster Liu Hung Chieh, he was taught their practical application: &#x201c;This is what they say; this is what they mean; this is how to do them.&#x201d; In the<i> TAO of Letting Go, </i>Frantzis offers a bridge to this pragmatic approach for living a spiritual life. Spirituality is not just an aspiration for which people strive, he says, but a genuine, accomplishable reality.<br><br>Frantzis shows how to expend maximum effort and yet not use force&#x2014;the gentle way of the Water method&#x2014;to enrich personal health and energy systems. The Water tradition continues the work of releasing inner conflicts, a process that begins with the Dissolving Method, passed down by Lao Tse in the <i>Tao Te Ching </i>over 2,500 years ago. The author shows how to completely let go of the blockages that bind and prevent the seeker from reaching full spiritual potential. Short, direct chapters and exercises cover such topics as breathing and awareness; Taoist meditation; fog and depression; modern anxiety; love and compassion; and more.</p><p>Bruce Frantzis is believed to be the first Westerner to hold authentic lineages in Taoist energy arts. He has a degree in acupuncture, and for over a decade was a chi gung healing specialist in Chinese medical clinics.

Stunning...&#34;Revolution in Time&#34; fairly radiates the author&#39;s own delight. Like the classic clocks it so lovingly describes, it is an exhilarating monument to human ingenuity. -- Jim Miller &#34;Newsweek&#34; The text scintillates with wise and witty aphorisms...Landes notes that clocks are the product of &#39;ingenuity, craftsmanship, artistry and elegance&#39;: so is this book. -- David Cannadine &#34;London Review of Books&#34; �Landes� has an eye for the odd, amusing detail and manages to convey a great enthusiasm for his subject...His book contains a wealth of piquant information that left me musing when I closed it. -- Tracy Kidder &#34;New York Times Book Review&#34; The book is a pleasure to read, for the quality of the author&#39;s thinking, for the slightly acid perceptiveness of his observations, and for the often enchanting aptness of his quotations and examples. -- E.

It is a light, summery day-dream. Accompanying &#39;The Sea Close By&#39; is the essay &#39;Summer in Algiers&#39;, a lovesong to his Mediterranean childhood.</p><p>French novelist, essayist, and playwright. Albert Camus (1913-1960) was a representative of non-metropolitan French literature. His origin in Algeria and his experiences there in the thirties were dominating influences in his thought and work. Among his works, The Plague (1947), The Just (1949) The Fall (1956). He was killed in a road accident in 1960. His last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared for the first time in 1994.</p><h2>The Book of Probes</h2><p>Marshall McLuhan was the master of the cryptic aphorism, or &#39;probe&#39;, and believed that the secret of perception lies in the power of words to either sharpen or dull the senses. He reveled in metaphor, allusion, implication and intimation and used probes to compress many of his complex and visionary ideas into a few thought provoking words; posing a new question interested him far more than confirming an idea. His probes push the participant into completing a thought process. The Book of Probes is a collection of Marshall McLuhan&#39;s finest words culled from his books, his over 200 speeches, his classes (especially the famed Monday Night Seminars), and from shorter writings he published between 1945 and 1980.</p><p>One of the most controversial and original thinkers of our time, McLuhan is universally regarded as the father of communications and media studies. But he is far more than that. A charismatic figure, whose remarkable perception propelled him onto the international stage, McLuhan became the prophet of the new information age. In his own time he drew both accolades and criticism for his intuitive vision, his steady stream of thought-provoking metaphors, and fast-forward glimpses into a world where software would eclipse hardware and the power of mass media would eclipse the power of government. The information superhighway fulfilled his perceptive observation that the world would ultimately become a global village.</p><h2>City of God: A Novel</h2><p>In his workbook, a New York City novelist records the contents of his teeming brain--sketches for stories, accounts of his love affairs, riffs on the meanings of popular songs, ideas for movies, obsessions with cosmic processes. He is a virtual repository of the predominant ideas and historical disasters of the age. But now he has found a story he thinks may be-come his next novel: The large brass cross that hung behind the altar of St. Timothy's, a run-down Episco-pal church in lower Manhattan, has disappeared...and even more mysteriously reappeared on the roof of the Synagogue for Evolutionary Judaism, on the Upper West Side. The church's maverick rector and the young woman rabbi who leads the synagogue are trying to learn who committed this strange double act of desecration and why. Befriending them, the novelist finds that their struggles with their respective traditions are relevant to the case. Into his workbook go his taped interviews, insights, preliminary drafts...and as he joins the clerics in pursuit of the mystery, it broadens to implicate a large cast of vividly drawn characters--including scientists, war veterans, prelates, Holocaust survivors, cabinet members, theologians, New York Times reporters, filmmakers, and crooners--in what proves to be a quest for an authentic spirituality at the end of this tortured century.<br><br>Daringly poised at the junction of the sacred and the profane, and filled with the sights and sounds of New York, this dazzlingly inventive masterwork emerges as the American novel readers have been thirsting for: a defining document of our times, a narrative of the twentieth century written for the twenty-first.</p><p>You want ambition? E.L. Doctorow's <i>City of God</i> starts off not merely with a bang but with the big bang itself, that "great expansive flowering, a silent flash into being in a second or two of the entire outrushing universe." It doesn't, to be sure, remain on this cosmic plane throughout. There's a mystery here, along with a romance, a chilling Holocaust narrative, and a deep-focus portrait of fin-de-si�cle Manhattan--not to mention cameo appearances by that Holy Trinity of contemporary mythmaking: Albert Einstein, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Frank Sinatra. But while the author of <i>Ragtime</i> and <i>Billy Bathgate</i> is no slacker when it comes to entertainment, he has more in mind this time around. Even the title, with its Augustinian overtones, tips us off to the author's preoccupation with belief, human consciousness, and "our wrecked romance with God."<p> Let's return, however, to that mystery. In the early pages of the novel, an enormous brass cross is pilfered from a church on the Lower East Side. Father Thomas Pemberton of St. Timothy's promptly sets off in search of it, dubbing himself the Divinity Detective. Yet he suspects from the start that this is no ordinary theft, with no ordinary solution: </p><blockquote> So now these people, whoever they are, have lifted our cross. It bothered me at first. But now I'm beginning to see it differently. That whoever stole the cross had to do it. And wouldn't that be blessed? Christ going where He is needed? </blockquote> Where He seems to be needed is the opposite side of the ecumenical aisle. The cross turns up on the roof of the Synagogue for Evolutionary Judaism, a tiny Manhattan institution to which Pemberton has clearly been led by fate. His encounter with the synagogue's rabbinical duo--a husband-and-wife team struggling to reclaim a pre-scriptural state of "unmediated awe"--transforms his life. It also destroys what's left of his conventional Christian belief. Augustine's spin on original sin, for example, now strikes him as "a nifty little act of deconstruction--passing it on to the children, like HIV." And as his relationship with Judaism deepens, he discards the clerical collar altogether and embarks upon a penitential exploration of the Holocaust--which in turn allows Doctorow to loop his narrative back and forth between several generations of (mostly) Jew and Gentile.<p> Astonishingly enough, the foregoing only scratches the surface of <i>City of God</i>. This marvelous hybrid also includes a metafictional framework (i.e., an author-as-character with a rather Doctorovian resume), an ongoing rumination on city life, and a dozen other major strands and minor players. There are, not surprisingly, a number of misfires. For example, Doctorow has long been interested in the power of American popular song--in the way that, say, Gershwin's work has come to function as a kind of secular hymnal. Yet the author's postmodernist variations on the standards, which appear at regular intervals throughout the novel under the ominous rubric of "The Midrash Jazz Quartet Plays the Standards," are jaw-droppingly awful. One might also argue that the book is too centrifugal, too devoted to the storytelling principle of the big bang. Still, there is an undeniable power to the way Doctorow makes his fictional worlds collide, setting off all manner of historical and philosophical conflagrations. At one point he imagines "the totality of intimate human narrations / composing a hymn to enlightenment / if that were possible." A tall order, yes. But despite its occasional longueurs, <i>City of God</i> suggests that it's possible indeed. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>"E.L. Doctorow is an astonishing novelist--astonishing not only in the virtuosity with which he deploys his mimetic skills, but also in the fact that it is impossible to predict even roughly the shape, scope and tone of one of his novels from its predecessors."--Robert Tower, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Doctorow is a master of atmosphere . . . He knows the art of storytelling inside and out."--Newsweek</p><h2>The Crisis of the Modern World</h2><p>Rene Guenon[1886-1951] struck the conscience of the western world by reminding it about the spiritual knowledge that was at the heart of all traditional civilizations but that the modern west had completely sight of.</p><p>Ren� Gu�non (1886&#x2013;1951) was one of the great luminaries of the twentieth century, whose critique of the modern world has stood fast against the shifting sands of intellectual fashion. His extensive writings, now finally available in English, are a providential treasure-trove for the modern seeker: while pointing ceaselessly to the perennial wisdom found in past cultures ranging from the Shamanistic to the Indian and Chinese, the Hellenic and Judaic, the Christian and Islamic, and including also Alchemy, Hermeticism, and other esoteric currents, they direct the reader also to the deepest level of religious praxis, emphasizing the need for affiliation with a revealed tradition even while acknowledging the final identity of all spiritual paths as they approach the summit of spiritual realization. Ren� Gu�non, of whom Jacob Needleman wrote in The Sword of Gnosis that &#x2018;no other modern writer has so effectively communicated the absoluteness of truth,&#x2019; is gradually being recognized by deeper thinkers as one of the few who have truly penetrated the seductive veil of the modern age. As an expositor of pure metaphysics and its application to the science of symbols, Gu�non is without peer; and his extraordinarily prescient critique of the modern world is attracting more and more attention among cultural commentators. Little known in the English-speaking world till the recent appearance of his Collected Works in translation, Gu�non has nevertheless long been recognized as a veritable criterion of truth by a vanguard of remarkable writers who evince that rare combination: intellectuality and spirituality. After a lonely childhood, often interrupted by ill health, Gu�non navigated the seductive half-truths of occultism toward a deeper, unified vision offering a way out from the confusion and fragmentation of our time. Regarded by leading scholars as the first truly authentic interpreter of many Eastern doctrines in the West, Gu�non never tired, in face of the seemingly inexorable process of dissolution in the twentieth century, of pointing to the transcendent unity of all religious faiths and the abiding Truth that contains them all.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Messy Spirituality: God&#39;s Annoying Love for Imperfect People</h2><p>&#39;I Guess I&#39;m Not a Very Good Christian . . .&#39; Do you feel like: I don&#39;t pray enough I don&#39;t read my Bible enough I don&#39;t share my faith enough I don&#39;t love God enough I&#39;m not committed enough I&#39;m not spiritual enough Then this book is for you. Messy Spiritualtiy was written for the silent majority of us who have been convinced that we just don&#39;t do Christianity right. We spend most of our lives worried about what we don&#39;t do instead of what we have done, focused on our imperfections instead of God&#39;s fondness for the imperfect. Why? Because we&#39;ve been bombarded with books, tapes, talks, seminars, and movies convincing us that real Christianity is all about perfection. Michael Yaconelli dares to suggest that imperfection, unfinishedness, and messiness are, in fact, the earmarks of true Christianity; that real Christianity is messy, erratic, lopsided . . . and gloriously liberating. What if genuine faith begins with admitting we will never have our act completely together? Maybe messy disciples are exactly the kind of imperfect people Jesus came to earth for and whose company he actually enjoyed--and still enjoys. If you want to find Jesus today, look for him in the midst of burned-out believers, moral misfits, religious incompetents . . . men and women whose lives are, well, messy. Messy Spirituality is a strong antidote for the spiritual perfectionism in us all. Here are truths that can cut you loose from the tyranny of ought-to&#39;s and open your eyes to the deep spirituality of being loved, shortcomings and all, by the God who meets you and transforms you in the midst of a messy and unpredictable life.</p><p>Mike Yaconelli is the author of bestselling books Dangerous Wonder and Messy Spirituality. He was the senior editor for the Wittenburg Door (1971-1996), a satirical religious magazine noted for its irreverent humor, in-depth interviews, and commitment to reforming the evangelical church. He was the cofounder of Youth Specialties, an international organization devoted to equipping youth workers through training and resources. Mike was a prophetic voice in the church-at-large and was a devoted husband and father until his death in 2003.

WILLIAM MCNAMARA Dear God, I&#39;m doing the best I can. Frank CHILDREN&#39;S LETTERS TO GOD I go into churches and everyone seems to feel so good about themselves. Everyone calls themselves a Christian nowadays. How dare we call ourselves Christians? It&#39;s only for Jesus to decide whether we are Christian or not. I don&#39;t think He&#39;s made a decision in my case, and I&#39;m afraid that when He does I am going to be sent straight to hell. I don&#39;t feel I can call myself a Christian. I can&#39;t be satisfied with myself. We all seem to be pretty contented with ourselves in church and that makes me sick. I think all this contentment makes Jesus nervous. ROBERT COLES, WITTENBURG DOOR My life is a mess. After forty-five years of trying to follow Jesus, I keep losing him in the crowded busyness of my life. I know Jesus is there, somewhere, but it&#39;s difficult to make him out in the haze of everyday life. For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be a godly person. Yet when I look at the yesterdays of my life, what I see, mostly, is a broken, irregular path littered with mistakes and failure. I have had temporary successes and isolated moments of closeness to God, but I long for the continuing presence of Jesus. Most of the moments of my life seem hopelessly tangled in a web of obligations and distractions. I want to be a good person. I don&#39;t want to fail. I want to learn from my mistakes, rid myself of distractions, and run into the arms of Jesus. Most of the time, however, I feel like I am running away from Jesus into the arms of my own clutteredness. I want desperately to know God better. I want to be consistent. Right now the only consistency in my life is my inconsistency. Who I want to be and who I am are not very close together. I am not doing well at the living-a-consistent-life thing. I don&#39;t want to be St. John of the Cross or Billy Graham. I just want to be remembered as a person who loved God, who served others more than he served himself, who was trying to grow in maturity and stability. I want to have more victories than defeats, yet here I am, almost sixty, and I fail on a regular basis. If I were to die today, I would be nervous about what people would say at my funeral. I would be happy if they said things like &#39;He was a nice guy&#39; or &#39;He was occasionally decent&#39; or &#39;Mike wasn&#39;t as bad as a lot of people.&#39; Unfortunately, eulogies are delivered by people who know the deceased. I know what the consensus would be. &#39;Mike was a mess.&#39; When I was younger, I believed my inconsistency was due to my youth. I believed that age would teach me all I needed to know and that when I was older I would have learned the lessons of life and discovered the secrets of true spirituality. I am older, a lot older, and the secrets are still secret from me. I often dream that I am tagging along behind Jesus, longing for him to choose me as one of his disciples. Without warning, he turns around, looks straight into my eyes, and says, &#39;Follow me!&#39; My heart races, and I begin to run toward him when he interrupts with, &#39;Oh, not you; the guy behind you. Sorry.&#39; I have been trying to follow Christ most of my life, and the best I can do is a stumbling, bumbling, clumsy kind of following. I wake up most days with the humiliating awareness that I have no clue where Jesus is. Even though I am a minister, even though I think about Jesus every day, my following is . . . uh . . . meandering. So I&#39;ve decided to write a book about the spiritual life. I know what you&#39;re thinking. Based on what I&#39;ve just said about my walk with God, having me write about spirituality is like having Bozo the Clown explain the meaning of the universe, like playing Handel&#39;s Messiah on the kazoo. How can someone whose life is obviously unspiritual presume to talk about holiness? It makes no sense. Unless. Unless! Unless spirituality, as most of us understand it, is not spirituality at all. Sadly, spiritual is most commonly used by Christians to describe people who pray all day long, read their Bibles constantly, never get angry or rattled, possess special powers, and have the inside track to God. Spirituality, for most, has an otherworldly ring to it, calling to mind eccentric &#39;saints&#39; who have forsaken the world, taken vows of poverty, and isolated themselves in cloisters. Nothing wrong with the spirituality of monks. Monks certainly experience a kind of spirituality, a way of seeking and knowing God, but what about the rest of us? What about those of us who live in the city, have a wife or husband, three children, two cats, and a washing machine that has stopped working? What about those of us who are single, work sixty to seventy hours a week, have parents who wonder why we&#39;re not married, and have friends who make much more money than we do? What about those of us who are divorced, still trying to heal from the scars of rejection, trying to cope with the single-parenting of children who don&#39;t understand why this has happened to them? Is there a spirituality for the rest of us who are not secluded in a monastery, who don&#39;t have it all together and probably never will?</p><h2>The Dead Zone: A Novel</h2><p>Stephen King's #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller about a reluctant clairvoyant who must weigh his options when he suddenly sees the terrible future awaiting mankind.<br><br><i>"There was only blackness and that universal emptiness... Cold limbo. Johnny Smith stayed there a long, long time."</i><br> <br>When Johnny Smith was six-years-old, head trauma caused by a bad ice-skating accident left him with a nasty bruise on his forehead and, from time to time, those hunches...infrequent but accurate snippets of things to come. But it isn&#x2019;t until Johnny&#x2019;s a grown man&#x2014;now having survived a horrifying auto injury that plunged him into a coma lasting four-and-a-half years&#x2014;that his special abilities <i>really</i> push to the fore. Johnny Smith comes back from the void with an extraordinary gift that becomes his life&#x2019;s curse...presenting visions of what was and what will be for the innocent and guilty alike. But when he encounters a ruthlessly ambitious and amoral man who promises a terrifying fate for all humanity, Johnny must find a way to prevent a harrowing predestination from becoming reality.</p><p>In the <i>St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers</i>, Gary Westfahl predicts that "King has already earned himself a place in the history of literature.... At the very least, he will enjoy the status of a latter-day Anthony Trollope, an author respected for his popularity and social commentary.... More likely, he will be enshrined as the Charles Dickens of the late 20th century, the writer who perfectly reflected, encapsulated, and expressed the characteristic concerns of his era." <p> If any of King's novels exemplifies his skill at portraying the concerns of his generation, it's <i>The Dead Zone</i> (1979). Although it contains a horrific subplot about a serial killer, it isn't strictly a horror novel. It's the story of an unassuming high school teacher, an Everyman, who suffers a gap in time--like a Rip Van Winkle who blacks out during the years 1970-75--and thus becomes acutely conscious of the way that American society is rapidly changing. He wakes up as well with a gap in his brain, the "dead zone" of the title. The zone gives him crippling headaches, but also grants him second sight, a talent he doesn't want and is reluctant to use. The crux of the novel concerns whether he will use that talent to alter the course of history.</p><p> <i>The Dead Zone</i> is a tight, well-crafted book. When asked in 1983 which of his novels so far was "the best," Stephen King answered, "The one that I think works the best is <i>Dead Zone</i>. It's the one that [has] the most story." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

But they're single-minded and very, very hungry. On land, they take the form of bosses, businesspeople, colleagues, family, and sociopathic neighbors. In the world of former governor of New Mexico and US ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson, they have taken the form of the most powerful people in the world. He's engaged in high-stakes, face-to-face negotiations with Castro, Saddam, the Taliban, two generations of North Korean leadership, and many more of the world's most infamous dictators&#x2014;and done it so well he was known as the "Undersecretary of Thugs" while with the Clinton administration. Now the 5-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee tells these stories&#x2014;from Washington, DC, to the Middle East to Pyongyang&#x2014;in all their intense and sometimes absurd glory.<br><i>How to Sweet-Talk a Shark</i> is a rare, candid, and entertaining glimpse into an insider's world of high-stakes negotiation &#x2013; showing Richardson's successes <i>and </i>failures in some of the world's least friendly places. Meanwhile, readers get frank lessons in the art of negotiation: how to prepare, how to size up your opponent, how to understand the nature of power in a standoff, how to give up only what is necessary while getting what you want, and many other strategies Richardson has mastered through at-the-table experience &#x2013; and from working with other master negotiators like Presidents Obama and Clinton, and Nelson Mandela. These are takeaways that anyone can use to negotiate with the power brokers, dealmakers, and, yes, the hungry sharks in their own lives.</p><p><b>Bill Richardson</b> is a two-term governor of New Mexico, former US ambassador to the UN, and former secretary of the Department of Energy. He spent 15 years in Congress and has successfully won the release of hostages, American servicemen, and prisoners in North Korea, Iraq, Cuba, and Sudan.<br><b>Kevin Bleyer</b> was an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning writer for <i>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</i> and author of <i>Me the People: One Man's Quest to Rewrite the Constitution of the United States of America</i>.The Clintons:<br><br>A CAUTIONARY TALE<br><br>I SEE YOU'VE ACCEPTED MY OFFER.<br><br>Rookie mistake.<br><br>The first offer is rarely the best offer--that's Negotiation 101. As my father told me a thousand times--in terms I, a baseball fanatic, could certainly understand--never swing at the first pitch. But you swung. That's okay.<br><br>After all, we all make mistakes. I've certainly made more than my share. It's a cliche that we often learn more from our failures than our successes, but it also happens to be true. Why? The sting of defeat hits us harder than the pleasure of victory. It's simply more powerful. I'll never do that again, we tell ourselves. Just wait till my next at bat.<br><br>Perhaps my biggest misstep, my most flagrant swing and miss--one that can be as instructive for you as it was for me--came in 2008, just as the race for the presidency that year was heating up. I tell myself I made this particular mistake, a rookie mistake by a veteran negotiator who should have known better--me--because in truth I wasn't the one doing the negotiating. Rather, I was being negotiated, by one of the best negotiators I've ever met: the same man who appointed me ambassador to the UN back in 1996. The same man who, famously, could negotiate everything, right down to what the definition of is is, and come out on the winning side of that linguistically mind-boggling argument.<br><br>So I tell myself I was outmatched by a master negotiator.<br><br>But the truth is, I bobbled an easy grounder.<br><br>In late January 2008, President Bill Clinton rang me with news: He wanted to see me again. Only this time, he didn't summon me to the White House as he had back in 1996--another fellow currently lived there--and his only shot to return was as the spouse of my competitor for the presidency. But so adamant was he that we should meet that he proposed--rather, he insisted- -that he would fly to New Mexico so we could meet in person. He had a good enough excuse: He suggested we watch the Super Bowl together. On February 3, the New York Giants would take on the New England Patriots in Glendale, Arizona. It promised to be a good game. Although if Bill had his way--and on this day, he certainly planned to--the featured entertainment that afternoon was going to take place in Santa Fe. And it too would be televised. Yes, just like in 1996, he wanted to say a few words about me on television, with me standing by his side.<br><br>Then he wanted me to speak the few words he had scripted for me:<br><br>"I endorse Hillary Clinton for president."<br><br>It may have been Super Bowl Sunday, but it was also smack in the middle of the heated primary race, and any punter could tell what his visit was really about. I had dropped out of the race the previous month, and since then my arm had been sore from all the twisting it had received from all corners in asking for my endorsement. Hillary called. Barack called. Even Ted Kennedy rang me in support of Obama. But Bill came the most, finding a number of excuses to swing by New Mexico in the days after I had withdrawn. But this was his big pitch. We'd watch the Super Bowl, but the action would be in Santa Fe: Bill Clinton was making a house call, conveniently two days before the New Mexico caucus and Super Tuesday, to twist my arm harder than the rest and secure my endorsement for his wife for the presidency.<br><br>The only problem: I wasn't going to play ball.<br><br>I did try to manage expectations about Bill's visit--to anyone who might take an interest and to Bill himself. For starters, I instructed my spokesman, Pahl Shipley, to tell the Associated Press, "There's no message intended by this." This is just two old friends getting together to watch sports--as if that's something Bill and I had done a thousand times before. (For the record, we hadn't.)<br><br>Yet despite my apparent hesitation, or perhaps because of the poor job I had done of dissuading him, Bill still thought he would negotiate an endorsement out of me. He even told the local reporters there'd be a press conference, as he planned to get my endorsement by halftime.<br><br>I knew he wouldn't succeed.<br><br>Yet I still let him do it.<br><br>I still let him come.<br><br>Even when it got complicated, I still let him come.<br><br>Even when a strong snowstorm made it impossible for the president's plane to land in Taos and we hastily made plans to relocate to the Governor's Mansion in Santa Fe--in other words, when I had a good excuse to cancel--I still let him come.<br><br>I still let a former president fly all the way to New Mexico, at great expense of his time, funds, and reputation--of blood and treasure, as they say in the war game--and I had not stepped in to stop it when it became obvious to the world what he was coming for.<br><br>Rookie mistake.<br><br>President Bill Clinton, who has at times been my friend and at others my foe, is a collection of superlatives.<br><br>Most everything complimentary said about the man is true. It's barely controversial to say he is perhaps the most natural politician of the modern era. To this day, he retains an unmatched ability to sweep through a room and charm each person he meets. When he finally departs, after tending carefully to each constituent--and we are all his constituents--for precisely the amount of time needed--no more, no less--to remind us, through a few perfectly chosen words and more perfectly chosen gestures, that life will be better after this meeting, he leaves behind the sense not only that someone important just stopped by, but also that something important just happened.<br><br>Even if it was just a handshake.<br><br>Yes, there's something about that handshake. He's got the best handshake in the biz. (And I should know. I have the Guinness World Record in most handshakes. But we'll get back to that.)<br><br>His speeches, even at their most winding and windy, render even other speechifiers speechless. And on that measure he just gets better; his keynote at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, as loquacious as ever, had the rafters shaking.<br><br>Everyone--men and women--says that when they're one-on-one with him, they get lost in his gaze. They can't all be wrong.<br><br>Simply: He was born to do this politics thing, and he's better at it than anyone. He rarely fails to impress. Having lived much of my political life in the Clinton era, I've seen this firsthand. When I was being considered for secretary of the interior and he and I discussed the land-use issues I'd be expected to address during my tenure, his knowledge of the minutiae of Native American affairs was daunting, and came preloaded. I remember thinking, Wait a minute here, I thought I was the New Mexican. I consider myself a pretty avid baseball fan, but he once put me to shame when I introduced him to Carlos Slim and the two of them got into a deep conversation about the most arcane batting statistics. I couldn't keep up. Bill is probably the only person who read the entire North American Free Trade Agreement. He's certainly the only person who could cite it chapter and verse. From memory.<br><br>The man is a sponge.<br><br>He is also a man of his word, at least in professional settings. He keeps the political promises he's made, even when it's inconvenient. And on this front, he knows the value of the personal touch. After he chose not to nominate me for the job at Interior, he called me up.<br><br>"How you feeling?"<br><br>He already knew how I was feeling. "I gotta be honest, Bill. This one hurt."<br><br>He felt my pain, the way he can.<br><br>"I hear you. But stay patient. These things tend to come 'round again."<br><br>In my case, they came around twice. I did stay patient, and sure enough, three years later, President Clinton rescued me from a goatherd's hut in Sudan and appointed me United States ambassador to the United Nations. Then in 1998, he appointed me secretary of energy. He felt he owed me, and even years later--when others might have forgotten--he paid up in full.<br><br>So yes, Bill Clinton is the best natural-born politician around, and he is a man of many virtues. But flip that coin--perhaps the coin he'll be on someday--and most everything unsavory said about the man also has to be considered. It's clear Bill has been on the receiving end of a parade of accusations over a long life in public service.<br><br>Lewinsky. Whitewater. Worse.<br><br>Is all of it true? Again, that may depend on what your definition of is is.<br><br>To be sure, there is a megalomania common to all of us who run for president. It takes a big ego to assume that you should be the leader of the free world. And on this measure, Bill leads the league. He does presume that the world revolves around him--not least because, for a time, it did.<br><br>After the professional help he had given me over the years, it's no surprise that I got a reputation as being a strong Clinton defender, even when it came to his personal life. And he clearly appreciated the support. But even I was surprised by how effusive he'd be in his thanks to me. "I love you, Billy," he'd say on many of his late-night phone calls. "I love you, man."<br><br>Some years later, for reasons I can't quite decipher, as the Clinton administration was winding down, I began to get a sense that my relationship with Bill was souring. The countless late-night phone calls talking about all manner of topics slowed to a trickle. (I realize how odd it may sound, but I missed hearing him tell me he loved me.) When I went to see him in the Oval Office to discuss my candidacy for DNC chairman, he was brusque. "Terry's getting that," he said, speaking of his friend Terry McAuliffe. "I'm not telling you not to run, but if you do, we're going to have to crush you." When I tried to press my case, the president did the oddest thing: He stood up in the middle of my sentence, walked over to a bookshelf, pulled down a book, and starting flipping through it, his back to me.<br><br>I was getting the cold shoulder from the president in the West Wing. If the Oval Office had had an ejector seat, I'm pretty sure he would have launched me onto the South Lawn. After a few moments of awkward silence, I picked up my things and left.<br><br>There have been moments of reprieve. A couple years later, we met up in Acapulco. Hillary and Bill were vacationing there, and my wife, Barbara, and I joined them. The four of us had a nice lunch full of laughs and grand plans, like old times. I also brought the world's richest man and a dear friend from my childhood, Carlos Slim, to meet the president. They were like little kids trying to outdo each other at baseball trivia. Slim later contributed heavily to the Clinton Foundation. But even through all that, I knew by then not to rely on that feeling of bonhomie. Our relationship had been hot and cold--and getting colder generally--and I had grown used to that.<br><br>So in 2008, I can't say I was surprised when he reached out to me during his wife's tight battle with Senator Obama--a battle I had withdrawn from myself only a month prior--and insisted that we enjoy a nice snowy afternoon in Santa Fe watching the Super Bowl with cold cuts, chips and salsa, and a dozen of our closest reporters. As halftime approached--and with it, the expected press conference--Bill still hadn't procured my endorsement. I leveled with him. "Bill, look. If you were running, I'd endorse you. But why should I endorse Hillary?" I had real reservations about the people she would bring in: the same old same old, as I saw it. It was clear he took my reluctance as a personal affront; to approve of Hillary is to approve of Bill. They come as a team. Still, I didn't find his counterarguments compelling. At halftime, instead of calling off the press conference, we invited in the photographers for thirty of the most awkward minutes of my life. When the assembled reporters asked us about what we were discussing, I let Bill do most of the talking--not my usual modus operandi. "The Giants have been great today," he said, ignoring the elephant in the room. "The defense has been unbelievable." When a reporter finally asked a direct question about the political race and Hillary's chances, all Bill could muster was "I hope she's going to win. . . . New Mexico has been very good to me. I love it here."<br><br>New Mexico may have been good to him, but I doubt he was loving New Mexico's governor at that moment. I was shocked that he didn't stand up, take a book off the shelf, and pretend to read. Heck, even I was wishing I had an ejector seat of my own. Not for him--for me. I wanted to be anywhere but there.<br><br>The game ended. The Giants won. The reporters left.<br><br>In the days that followed, Bill made other motions to pry an endorsement out of me. I learned later that he even asked Henry Cisneros, who had worked with Clinton as housing and urban development secretary, to intervene. "He thought I could deliver you," Henry told me.<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"I guess he thought we spoke the same language."<br><br>"Politics?"<br><br>"Spanish."<br><br>Hey, I can't blame Bill. Whatever works. Lo que funcione.<br><br>At this point, it must be obvious. I'd been presented with a negotiator's doomsday scenario: a high-stakes, high-tension no-win situation. On one hand, I could embrace my friendship with Bill Clinton, endorse his wife for president . . . and compromise my beliefs. Or I could endorse Senator Obama, honor what felt right to me . . . and lose my most powerful political ally and one of my closest friends.<br><br>I hope you're never presented with such a situation, but this is the real world and these things happen. Ultimately, you'll have to choose. It will be painful. It'll force you to negotiate with yourself on a deep level--an ongoing theme in this book, as you'll see. It'll put your character to the test. But I do think you'll know very early on which choice to make, even though you'll lie to yourself about that. Finally, I made mine.<br><br>A month later, at a huge rally in Oregon, I endorsed Barack Obama.

His work spans the range from academic to popular. While making his subject matter attractive and accessible to a wide audience, his material is factually based. He has written or co-written 25 books since 1979, been involved in a number of television productions, and has also written a range of peer-reviewed academic papers.An independent specialist breezily and a bit tendentiously summarizes the archaeological and anthropological understanding, such as it is, of the widespread use of hallucinogenic plants around the world since the earliest times. Devereux's interpretation of indirect archaeological evidence of psychedelic use in ancient western Europe often comes across as highly speculative. But it's an intriguing look at the kinds of clues ``cognitive archaeologists'' use to reconstruct long-lost behavior, and in any case the brisk global tour of long-exploited psychoactive plants leaves no doubt of the intimate relation between these drugs and most human cultures--the notable exception being our own. From early Eurasia (the familiar red-capped fly agaric mushroom and the legendary soma) to Africa (ibogaine and khat), through the arcane traditions of Native Americans and the plant lore of ``witchcraft,'' natural hallucinogens have been an integral part of shamanic religions' belief in a higher plane. Devereux, constantly emphasizing the role of context in any psychedelic experience, takes pains to show that hallucinogens were usually strictly regulated aspects of a coherent culture's rites. Thus, while not simply proselytizing for the indiscriminate use of psychedelics, Devereux is fanatically keen to demonstrate what modern Western culture is missing out on in its underappreciation of this history (as well as of expanded consciousness itself). Because of this underappreciation, much such study has been performed outside of mainstream anthropology and archaeology. As a consequence, perhaps, while Devereux's book is a handy summary of this research, much information seems sketchily documented, when it is not outright unexplained assertion. Devereux's claims for the true insights afforded by psychedelics (including prediction and remote viewing) invite some skepticism, too. But he shows that judgments would be better made in a climate of rational inquiry into the obviously basic human predilection for altered consciousness.

Though parts of the work are now lost, the remaining sections which have been translated offer valuable insights into Inca culture and Peruvian history.</p><p>Inca Religion and Customs is the second translation by Roland Hamilton from Cobo's massive work. Beginning where History of the Inca Empire left off, it provides a vast amount of data on the religion and lifeways of the Incas and their subject peoples. Despite his obvious Christian bias as a Jesuit priest, Cobo objectively and thoroughly describes many of the religious practices of the Incas. He catalogs their origin myths, beliefs about the afterlife, shrines and objects of worship, sacrifices, sins, festivals, and the roles of priests, sorcerers, and doctors.</p><p>The section on Inca customs is equally inclusive. Cobo covers such topics as language, food and shelter, marriage and childrearing, agriculture, warfare, medicine, practical crafts, games, and burial rituals.</p><p>Because the Incas apparently had no written language, such postconquest documents are an important source of information about Inca life and culture. Cobo's work, written by one who wanted to preserve something of the indigenous culture that his fellow Spaniards were fast destroying, is one of the most accurate and highly respected.</p></p><p>Bernabe Cobo (1582&#x2013;1657) was a Spanish Jesuit who lived for many years in colonial Spanish America.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Surf Is Where You Find It</h2><p>Written by one of the most revered surfers of his generation, Gerry Lopez's <i>Surf Is Where You Find It</i> is a collection of stories about a lifetime of surfing.

Donaldson, Patrick McGrath, and more.</p><p>The high-voltage combination of sex and horror delivers its promised thrills in several of these stories, although some masters of the genre are seen at less than their best. Standouts include the lively and funny "Death and the Single Girl," in which Thomas Disch tells what happens to a temp secretary who has given up on life and decides to call Death at the phone number she has acquired on a bus trip to a World Fellowship camp in the Catskills. Clive Barker enthralls with his eerie and powerful tale of a housewife in the depths of despair, who discovers supernatural powers in both her rage and sexuality. On the other hand, Stephen King's "The Revelations of 'Becka Paulson" is a relatively tame account of another housewife's loosening hold on sanity after she accidentally shoots herself. Ruth Rendell also disappoints with a predictable and unsuspenseful last meeting of lovers. Other contributors include Valerie Martin and Patrick McGrath.

P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, and some of the nation's biggest banks. Today, Hetty Green ranks near the top of America's list of greatest financiers, in company with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and billionaire-investor Warren Buffett. But in history books she has remained merely a footnote, a miser and an eccentric, whose character flaws and personal choices unjustly overshadowed her remarkable accomplishments on the fierce battlefield of American industry and commerce.</p><p>In Hetty, Charles Slack reexamines the life, work, and conflicted legacy of the exceptionally resourceful, ruthless, and inimitable woman who turned a comfortable inheritance into a fortune through instinct, courage, cunning, greed, and determination to succeed at a man's game on her own terms: from her childhood in the Quaker community of New Bedford, Massachusetts, where she learned about business by reading financial papers to her father, to the battle over her inheritance that was one of the most controversial legal cases of her time; from her collisions with railroad magnate Collis Huntington to her rescue of New York City from financial ruin.</p><p>Looking well beyond the lore and historical prejudices, Charles Slack presents a full portrait of a true American original, a female Citizen Kane who, having turned away from the conventions of her time, as a woman, a wife, a mother, and a mogul, led a life of a different sort, with occasionally tragic results, becoming both a hero and a victim of her era. Above all, it is a story of an uncompromising, larger-than-life, flawed woman who ruled a vast financial empire but was known, simply, as Hetty.</p></p><p><p>Charles Slack is the author of <em>Noble Obsession: Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock, and the Race to Unlock the Greatest Industrial Secret of the Nineteenth Century</em>, named one of the New York Public Library's twenty-five "Books to Remember" for 2002, and <em>Blue Fairways: Three Months, Sixty Courses, No Mulligans</em>. His writing has appeared in many national magazines. He lives in Connecticut with his wife, Barbara, and their daughters, Natalie and Caroline.</p>Hetty Green (1835-1916) was the only woman to make her mark in the financial markets during the Guilded Age of the late 1800s. She parlayed an inheritance of $500,000 into $100 million ($2.5 billion in current money), amassing fortunes in U.S. bonds and real estate through impeccable timing. Immortalized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the "world's greatest miser," she kept her family living in modest tenements, dressed in drab clothes, and was a notorious penny-pincher. Dubbed the "Witch of Wall Street," she was widely believed to live an unhappy existence despite her riches. Slack's account reveals a much more multidimensional character than Green was popularly believed to be; yes, she was eccentric, but her wry wit and colorful personality bring humor and pathos to this story. She was unfairly vilified because of her sex, and readers cannot help from cheering for her at every turn. <i>David Siegfried</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Travel back in time to the kingdom of Terrestria, a land where knights and their ladies live in castles and where dragons still roam (occasionally). The Terrestria Chronicles allegory series was written with a three-fold purpose: to honor Jesus Christ as King, to challenge young readers to love and serve Him, and to teach them to guard their hearts for Him. The focus of the series is always on the King. This is not Narnia; this is not Lord of the Rings. The Terrestria Chronicles were written to honor Christ and be as true to Scripture as possible. Some readers have compared the Terrestria books to The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, though this series is much more readable, relevant, and action-packed than Bunyan&#39;s classic work. Written for ages ten and up, the Terrestria series is ideal for family devotions, classroom use, or individual enjoyment. When King Emmanuel sends Prince Josiah on a difficult journey to various castles across the kingdom, the young prince is unprepared for the dangers that he will face. But if he can reach all seven castles he will obtain seven priceless jewels for his Shield of Faith! Alive with fast-paced adventure in a medieval setting, Book 2 of the delightful Terrestria allegory series challenges the reader to examine his/her relationship with the King.</p><p>Evangelist Ed Dunlop Ed Dunlop has worked in children&#39;s ministries full-time for thirty-two years. As an evangelist, he conducts Kids Crusades in local churches, presents teacher-training seminars, speaks at junior camps, and conducts visualized drug and alcohol awareness programs in public elementary and junior high schools. His ministry involves ventriloquism, Gospel magic, blacklight effects, and a variety of other visual media. Ed writes fiction for children and resource books for teachers, and currently has twenty-four titles in print with five publishers. His books for teachers, I Can&#39;t Wait Till Sunday Morning! and How Do I Get These Kids to Listen? are bestsellers with Sword Publishers. His Young Refugee historical series includes Escape to Liechtenstein and The Incredible Rescues. His latest allegory series, the seven title Terrestria Chronicles, is a must-read for any family raising children in today s society. The author grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He was raised in a Christian home and was led to Christ as a young child by his mother. He graduated from Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College in 1975 at the age of nineteen, and has served churches in California, Arizona, and Tennessee as assistant pastor and Christian Education Director. He and his family entered full-time evangelism in March of 1988. Ed and his wife, Janice, have three children, Rebecca, Steve and Phillip, and make their home in north Georgia. Ed enjoys canoeing, motorcycling and SCUBA diving. His sons are also certified divers. Ed currently serves as a volunteer diver at the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and enjoys feeding the fish, sharks, stingrays and moray eels as groups of school children watch.I was very excited to have a chance to read and review this series of Christian allegory fiction. I am always looking to share with my kids some good books that explain, on their level, the story of what it means to be a Christian and what Jesus did for us by dying on the cross. I have found that in The Terrestria Chronicles! When these books arrived at my home, my 13-year old daughter grabbed them and headed to her room to read them. She s a fast reader and emerged a few days later telling me that she really liked the series and thought that I would, too. It took me a lot longer than a few days to read the series, but they were hard to put down once I got started! The Terrestria Chronicles consists of seven books: - The Sword, The Ring and The Parchment - The Quest for Seven Castles - The Search for Everyman - The Crown of Kuros - The Dragon s Egg - The Golden Lamps - The Great War The series centers around a medieval theme of knights, princesses, castles, etc. Christ is King Emmanuel and the King saves the main character, Josiah, from Argamor (Satan) in the first book. After Josiah is brought into the Kingdom of Terrestria, he is mentored by Sir Faithful and learns what it means to be a son of the King. In each book, Josiah undergoes various trials and learns about faith, the power of his King, and that he cannot rely on his own power to gain success. In the third book, The Search for Everyman, two more main characters are introduced Prince Selwyn and his sister, Princess Gilda. They aid Josiah in his many adventures throughout the rest of the series. One aspect of the books that I really liked was the naming of many of the many peoples and places Sir Wisdom, the Path of Righteousness, the Castle of Faith, Captain Temptation, Woebegone, Discouragement and so on. The series is written for ages 10 and up; some younger readers won t know the definition of some of these names, but they will get a general understanding of their meanings after reading through these books! The Biblical principles that are taught in this book are sound and I found the allegories in each story helpful in showing me a new way to look at the lessons in the Bible. I don&#39;t want to give any specific examples, but I loved the way that the author takes modern day items and ideas and shows how they are Satan s tools for trying to draw us away from our Lord. We are encouraged over and over again to make Christ our first priority and shown the value of doing so. My favorite book was The Great War which tells the story of the book of Revelation in terms that a child can understand. It is the final book in the series and depicts the greatness of our King, leaving a lasting impression in my mind. I thought about this book for several days afterwards. I plan to read this series with my son as his Bible study during our upcoming school year. We will go through one book monthly, reading and discussing each story and learning more about our King of kings and Lord of lords! I know that he will be enraptured by the fantasy setting and able to identify with Josiah. I have read a modified children&#39;s version of The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress with my children, but I believe that The Terrestria Chronicles are much easier to understand while getting many of the same points across to the reader. They are definitely more action-packed! I highly recommend this series for all families ... it will open up a whole new world of understanding of what it means to be a son or daughter of our wonderful King! - Product Review by Kris Price, Assistant to the Publishers, The Old Schoolhouse Magazine, LLC --The Old Schoolhouse Magazine</p><h2>After 50,000 Miles</h2><p>The author shares experiences and expertise acquired during eleven years spent sailing across the world&#39;s oceans with his wife on their thirty-five-foot yacht</p><p></p><h2>Melanie Klein: Her World and Her Work</h2><p>Underestimated until recently in America, Melanie Klein was a leading figure in psychoanalytic circles from the 1920s until her death in 1960. From the moment she read Freud&#x2019;s paper <i>On Dreams</i> she was enraptured, converted, and dedicated to psychoanalysis. She was the first European psychoanalyst to become a member of the British Psychoanalytical Society, and ultimately she became its dominant influence. Drawing on a wealth of hitherto unexplored documents as well as extensive interviews with people who knew and worked with Klein, Phyllis Grosskurth has written a superb account of this complicated woman and her theories&#x2015;theories that are still growing in influence.</p><p>Phyllis Grosskurth is a professor of English at the University of Toronto.&#x201c;Remarkable... [Grosskurth] skillfully handles a wide range of source materials... Much of the book&#x2019;s power comes from Mrs. Grosskurth&#x2019;s access to Melanie Klein&#x2019;s own, unpublished autobiography, which evokes a haunting and recurrent question about the status of psychoanalytic knowledge: the question of the unanalyzed analyst... The analytic movement perpetuates myths about the successful analyses of its founder and major theorists. Phyllis Grosskurth&#x2019;s new biography explodes such simple myths, forcing us to ask once again if the status of psychoanalytic theory is challenged by the vulnerability of psychoanalysts. But is also provides rich new materials for thinking through this problem. It testifies to the courage if not the calm of a woman who drew on her own unresolved suffering to bring other analysts face to face with the &#x2018;witches of the night.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sherry Turkle</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A biography that is fascinating, profound, and in every respect worthy of its subject.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Ingleby</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] fascinating biography... Its great strength lies in the author&#x2019;s ability to bring characters and controversies to life... The great &#x2018;Controversial Discussions&#x2019; of the 1940s form the heart of Grosskurth&#x2019;s narrative. She brilliantly recreates the motives of the participants, while deftly untangling the complex issues at stake... We are very much in Phyllis Grosskurth&#x2019;s debt.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Robinson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Melanie Klein, the pioneer of child psychiatry who died in London in 1960, was surely one of the most controversial figures in modern psychoanalysis. As one American doctor remarked, &#x2018;Freud made sex respectable; Melanie Klein made aggression respectable.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Elaine Showalter</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A rich historical source that can perhaps help psychoanalysis to remember rather than to relive its past.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Helen Block Lewis</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Grosskurth&#x2019;s detailed, comprehensive, and panoramic study of Klein, her work, and her times...is a very valuable and important contribution... [Grosskurth] presents Klein&#x2019;s life and the development of her theories with an impressive command over the details and the complex (often highly technical) issues. Most valuable is the treasure trove of reflections and memories from many of the key figures in recent psychoanalytic history, making this an invaluable document in the recording of oral history... It is a riveting, inspirational story, told with a strong narrative voice, with many cameo portraits and subplots, creating a rich panorama of crucial decades in psychoanalytic history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen A.

Then many uncritically embraced it. This book represents an emerging third stage in the complicated relationship between faith and psychology. That stage is the critical, theologically informed appropriation of psychotherapy. Stanton Jones and Richard Butman, respected Christian scholars and experienced clinical psychologists, survey the thirteen most significant psychotherapies now in use. They fair-mindedly introduce each therapy and evaluate its compatibility with orthodox Christianity. Opening and closing chapters discuss foundational concerns on the intergration of psychology and theology, and present the author&#39;s justification of &#34;responsible eclecticism.&#34; Among the first of its kind, this comprehensive volume will be of invaluable assistance to teachers, students of psychology, and Christian psychologists and counselors.</p><p>Stanton L. Jones is provost and professor of psychology at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. During his tenure as chair of the psychology department (1984-1996), he led the development of Wheaton's Doctor of Psychology program in clinical psychology. He received his B.S. in psychology from Texas A &amp; M University in 1976, and his M.A. (1978) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in clinical psychology from Arizona State University. He is a member of the American Psychological Association and served on the Council of Representatives, the central governing body of the APA, representing the Psychology of Religion division from 1999 to 2001. In 1994 he was named a Research Fellow of the Evangelical Scholars Program of the Pew Foundation. He was a Visiting Scholar at the Divinity School of the University of Cambridge and a Visiting Fellow at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge, for the 1995-1996 academic year. Jones authored the lead article, "Religion and Psychology," for the <em>Encyclopedia of Psychology,</em> jointly published in 2000 by the American Psychological Association and Oxford University Press. His article in the March 1994 <em>American Psychologist,</em> titled "A Constructive Relationship for Religion with the Science and Profession of Psychology: Perhaps the Best Model Yet," was a call for greater respect for and cooperation with religion by secular psychologists. Jones has also written, with his wife, Brenna, a five-book series on sex education in the Christian family called God's Design for Sex. He is also the coauthor of <em>Modern Psychotherapies</em> (with Richard E. Butman) and <em>Homosexuality: The Use of Scientific Research in the Church's Moral Debate</em> (with Mark A. Yarhouse) and editor of <em>Psychology and Christianity: Four Views.</em> He has published many other professional and popular articles and chapters."For any Christian student considering a career as a counselor, this book should be high on the list of required reading. For any teacher of a course related to counseling or therapy, this text should be a strong candidate."

The miracle is that in doing so he was able to compose this stunningly eloquent memoir.In a voice that is by turns wistful and mischievous, angry and sardonic, Bauby gives us a celebration of the liberating power of consciousness: what it is like to spend a day with his children, to imagine lying in bed beside his wife, to conjure up the flavor of delectable meals even as he is fed through at tube. Most of all, this triumphant book lets us witness an indomitable spirit and share in the pure joy of its own survival.</p><p>We've all got our idiosyncrasies when it comes to writing--a special chair we have to sit in, a certain kind of yellow paper we absolutely must use. To create this tremendously affecting memoir, Jean-Dominique Bauby used the only tool available to him--his left eye--with which he blinked out its short chapters, letter by letter. Two years ago, Bauby, then the 43-year-old editor-in-chief of <i>Elle</i> France, suffered a rare stroke to the brain stem; only his left eye and brain escaped damage. Rather than accept his "locked in" situation as a kind of death, Bauby ignited a fire of the imagination under himself and lived his last days--he died two days after the French publication of this slim volume--spiritually unfettered. In these pages Bauby journeys to exotic places he has and has not been, serving himself delectable gourmet meals along the way (surprise: everything's ripe and nothing burns). In the simplest of terms he describes how it feels to see reflected in a window "the head of a man who seemed to have emerged from a vat of formaldehyde.""Was it Hemingway who defined grace under pressure? No matter who said it, the words have never been more pertinent than in speaking of this heroic book, dictated against the worst imaginable adversities. Although every word cost the author a superhuman effort, the prose is not sickbed telegraphese but rather as light as the sprightliest humor, as pungent as the taste of cooking apricots, as vigorous as the step of a young man setting out on a first date. Read this book and fall back in love with life."<br>-- <b>Edmund White</b><p>"To read this most extraordinary of narratives is to discover the luminosity within a courageous man's mind. Locked into his own world but not locked out of ours, [<b>]Jean-Dominique Bauby[</b>] explores images, memories and an entire landscape of fantasy and love. His incomparable final gift to us is a heartbreaking and yet glorious testament to the wrenching beauty of the human spirit."<br>-- <b>Sherwin B. Nuland, M.D.</b></p><p>"As riveting as a narrative from an explorer of deep space, this communication from a mind imprisoned in an unresponsive body is remarkable for its utter lack of self-pity or sentimentality. Though 'locked in' the author's consciousness freely roams through worlds of memory, fantasy, sense, impression, and contemplation of the human condition. An unforgettable read." <br>-- <b>Andrew Weil</b></p><p>"This heartbreaking story by a uniquely gifted writer is about transforming pain into creativity, human despair into literary miracle." <br>-- <b>Elie Wiesel</b></p></p><h2>The Parables of Kryon</h2><p>Anyone who is ready for the next evolutionary step, this information from Kryon is invaluable. It is both self-healing and planetary healing.</p><p>Kryon is a multiple inter-dimensional entity. After graduating with a business and economics degree from California Western University in California, Lee Carroll started a technical audio business in San Diego that flourished for 30 years. As an engineer, where do channelling and Indigo children fit into all this? As Lee tells it, God had to hit him &#34;between the eyes&#34; to prove his spiritual experience was real. The year 1989 was the turning point when the first psychic told him about his spiritual path, and then three years later when the second unrelated psychic told him the same thing! Timidly, the first writings were presented to the metaphysical community in Del Mar, California, and the rest is history-a total of nine metaphysical books were released in a seven-year span. There are now over a half a million books in print in 14 languages: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Hebrew, English, Danish, Italian, Greek, Hungarian, Japanese, and Turkish. Also represented are the languages of the Netherlands and Finland. Lee and his spiritual partner, Jan Tober, started the &#34;Kryon light groups&#34; in Del Mar in 1991 and quickly moved from a living-room setting to a Del Mar church. Now they&#39;re hosting meetings all over the globe, with audiences of up to 3,000 people in Europe alone. In the beginning days of the Internet, Kryon had the largest consistent New Age folder in the history of America Online, and now attracts many more electronic browsers on his Website, which you can visit at [www.kryon.com]. Also on the Website is an on-line magazine where new Kryon and Indigo-related articles are featured regularly. Perhaps the most moving meeting with Jan and Lee occurred in Tel Aviv, Israel, in October 2000. Amid the strife and violent uprisings at that time in the Middle East, messages were given to a single group of more than 1,000 Israelites that were uplifting and positive. (This message is available on the Kryon Website, listed above.) In 1995, Lee and Jan were asked to present the Kryon work at the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City before a U.N.-chartered group known as the Society for Enlightenment and Transformation (S.E.A.T.). The meeting was so well accepted that they were invited back two more times, in 1996 and in 1998, to present their message of love! Lee is the author of nine Kryon books, and is the co-author (along with Jan) of The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived. Lee continues to write from his home in San Diego, living with his wife, Patricia, and his Maltese dog, Mini.</p><h2>Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt (A catalogue of Roman portraits in the British Museum) by Susan Walker (1997-03-03)</h2><p>The painted panel and shroud portraits of Roman Egypt constitute the only corpus of coloured images of individuals to survive from classical antiquity. Many are of outstanding artistic quality, and as a whole they reflect a range of techniques and styles. The images combine both the subject&#39;s belief in the traditional Egyptian cults, which offered them a firm prospect of life after death, and the Roman manner, of reflecting the subject&#39;s status in life. The portraits reveal the adoption of Roman fashions in dress and personal adornment by persons remote from the centre of the empire, but likely to have been actively engaged in its local administration. Many of the best known portraits come from the Fayum, but others in various media are known from sites in the Nile Valley and along the Mediterranean coast. This catalogue, published to coincide with an exhibition at the British Museum, presents a wide range of these portraits, showing the Roman influence coexisting with traditional Egyp</p><p></p><h2>M.Y.T.H.

She by ambition DIARY OF AN OXYGEN THIEF is honest hilarious and heartrending but above all a very real account of what we do to each other and what we allow to have done to us.</p><p>Anonymous is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of<i> Diary of an Oxygen Thief.</i>I liked hurting girls.<br> Mentally, not physically, I never hit a girl in my life. Well, once. But that was a mistake. I'll tell you about it later. The thing is, I got off on it. I really enjoyed it.<br> It's like when you hear serial killers say they feel no regret, no remorse for all the people they killed. I was like that. Loved it. I didn't care how long it took either, because I was in no hurry. I'd wait until they were totally in love with me. Till the big saucer eyes were looking at me. I loved the shock on their faces. Then the glaze as they tried to hide how much I was hurting them. And it was legal. I think I<br> killed a few of them. Their souls, I mean. It was their souls I was after. I know I came close a couple of times. But don't worry, I got my comeuppance. That's why I'm telling you this. Justice was done. Balance has been restored. The same thing happened to me, only worse. Worse because it happened to me. I feel purged now, you see. Cleansed. I've been punished, so it's okay to talk about it all. At least that's how it seems to me. I carried the guilt of my crimes around with me for years after I stopped drinking. I couldn't even look at a girl, much less believe I deserved to converse with one. Or maybe I was just afraid that they'd see through me. Either way, after getting into Alcoholics Anonymous, I didn't even kiss a girl for five years. Seriously. Not so much as holding hands.<br> I meant business.<br> I think I always knew deep down I had a drinking problem. I just never got around to admitting it. I drank purely for effect. But then, as far as I was concerned, wasn't everyone doing the same thing? I started to realize something was wrong when I began to get beaten up. My mouth always got me into trouble, of course. I'd go up to the biggest guy in the place and look up his nostrils and call him a faggot. And then when he'd head-butt me, I'd say, "Call that a headbutt?" So the guy would do it again harder. The second time I'd have less to say. One of my "victims" stuck my head on an electric cooker ring. In Limerick. Stab City. I was lucky to get out of that house alive. He'd done it, though, because I'd been taking the pith out of hiths listhp. Maybe that's why I moved on to girls. More sophisticated, doncha know. And girls wouldn't beat me up. They'd just stare at me in disbelief and shock.<br> Their eyes, you see.<br> All the pretense and rules dissolved away. There was just the two of us and the pain. All those intimate moments, every little sigh, those gentle touches, the lovemaking, the confidences, the orgasms, the attempted orgasms-all mere fuel. The deeper in they were, the more beautiful they looked when the moment came.<br> And I lived for the moment. I was working freelance in advertising all through this period in London. As an art director. A contradiction in terms if ever there was one. It's what I still do today. Strangely, I<br> was always able to get money. Even in art school, I got a grant because my dad had just retired and I suddenly became eligible. And after that I got job after job without too much trouble.<br> I never looked like a drunk, I just was one, and anyway in those days advertising was a far more boozy affair than it is today. Because I was freelance, I could be my own man, so to speak, and I would keep myself busy by ensuring I had dates lined up. None of the girls were supposed to know this. The idea was to have an impressive queue so that when one girl neared maturity-usually after about three or four dates with some phone calls in between-another would be introduced. Then as one went onto the scrap heap, a new one would take her place. Nothing unusual about my method, everyone did it. But I enjoyed it so much. Not the sex or even the conquest, but the causing of pain.<br> It was after my crazy night with Pen (more on that in a minute) that I realized I had found my niche in life. Somehow I was able to lure these creatures into my lair. Half the time I was trying to push them away, but it had just the opposite effect. And the fact that they were attracted to a piece of shit like me made me hate them even more than if<br> they'd laughed in my face and walked away. As for looks? I'm nothing special, but I'm told I have beautiful eyes. Eyes from which nothing but truth could possibly seep.<br> They say the sea is actually black and that it merely reflects the blue sky above. So it was with me. I allowed you to admire yourself in my eyes. I provided a service. I listened<br> and listened and listened. You stored yourself in me.<br> Nothing had ever felt so right to me. If I'm honest, even today I miss hurting. I'm not cured of it, but I don't set out to systematically dismantle like I used to. I don't miss the booze half as much. Oh, to hurt again. Since those heady days I heard an adage that seems to apply here: "Hurt people hurt people."<br> I see now that I was in pain and wanted others to feel it, too. This was my way of communicating. I'd meet the women the first night and get the obligatory phone number and then after another couple of days, making them sweat a little, I'd call and be all nervous. They loved that. I'd ask them out and pretend I hardly ever did "this kind of thing" and say that I hadn't been out a lot in London because I didn't really know the scene. This was true, though, because all I used to do was get out of my head in local bars around Camberwell.<br> We'd agree to meet somewhere. I liked Greenwich, with the river and the boats and of course the pubs. And it had a great boyfriend/girlfriend feel. Nice and respectable. I'd be half out of it before we even met, but I'd be witty and charming and boyish and shaking. Trying to put me at ease, they'd smile and comment on my trembling, thinking I was nervous to create a good impression. Because I wasn't getting in enough booze, my very being would shudder. I'd have to order two large Jamesons at the counter for her every half lager. I'd down the Jimmys without her seeing and then on with the show.<br> Lovely.<br> I didn't really care if I got them into bed or not. I just wanted some company while I got pissed, while I waited for the courage to hurt to well up in me. And they seemed pleased because I wasn't trying to grope them. Sometimes I would. But mostly I'd be fairly well behaved. This would go on for a few dates. In the meantime I would encourage them to tell me about themselves.<br> This is very important for the successful moment later. The more they confided and invested in you, the deeper the shock and the more satisfying the moment at the end. So, I'd be told of their dog's habits, their teddy bear's names, their father's moods, their mother's fears. Did I like kids? How many brothers and sisters did I have? A sitcom I had to sit through. But it was okay, because I knew I'd be writing her out of the series.<br> She'd talk and talk and talk, and I'd nod. Raise a strategic eyebrow. Grimace when necessary. Guffaw or feign shock, whatever was required. I'd watch people in conversation and record their facial expressions. Interest: Raise one eyebrow and raise or lower the other depending on the conversation.<br> Attraction: Try to blush. Not easy, this (thoughts of what I was going to do to her later helped). And a blush usually begot a blush. That is, if I could muster a blush, she was more than likely to blush back. Sympathy: Crinkle the forehead and nod gently. Charmed: Cock your head to one side and smile apologetically. I'd supply these prefab masks on cue. It was easy. It was enjoyable. Guys did it all the time to get laid. I did it to get even. Unkind to Womankind. That was my mission. Around this time I discovered the meaning of the word "misogynist." I remember thinking it hilarious that it had "Miss" as a prefix.<br> All I know is, I felt better when I saw someone else in pain. But of course they would often hide how much I had hurt them. Yes, it was a challenge in itself to help her externalize her feelings, but also bloody frustrating to have gone to all that trouble and then not be able to enjoy a dramatic playback. That's why it became necessary to condense everything into the one demonstrative moment.<br> Sophie was from South London. She used to do the wardrobe for Angus Brady on the comedy show Aren't You Glad to See Me? I met her at a Camberwell College of Arts party that I had crashed. After her, there was that designer girl-whose name I honestly can't remember-who I'm sure I hurt very deeply because she never called me back. Funny that, because even though I never met her again or even heard her say another word, I knew she had it bad.<br> How do I know?<br> I know.<br> There was Jenny. She was the one who threw the beer in my face. I was thrilled to have had a hand in causing so much rage.<br> Then came Emily. But she doesn't really count because she was as good if not better at whatever this is than I was. I kind of fell for her. Laura was somewhere in there. An ex- band publicist with a superb arse that had survived a young daughter. I woke up one morning and there was an eight-year-old girl watching as I tried to extricate myself from the freckled tentacles of her comatose mother. And then after she guilted me into walking her to school, I got the feeling that mother and daughter made full use of the men that passed through their lives. Like the Native American and the Buffalo, The Eskimo and the Seal, The Welfare Mother and Me.<br> And the one who started it all.<br> Penelope Arlington. I'd been going out with her for four and a half years. Long time. She'd been nice to me. Nicer to me than any other girl had ever been. When I spoke, she turned her head toward me and seemed to abandon herself to the meaning of my words. I liked that. It was only much later that I found out she was terrible in bed. At the time I thought she was wanton. She wasn't. But she's the one I regret hurting the most. Why? Because she didn't deserve it. Not that the others did, but she wouldn't have left me if I hadn't ripped her apart. And I needed her to leave me because she was getting in the way of my drinking.<br> And one night I just cracked up. It'd been bubbling for ages. Simmer, simmer, bubble, stew . . . gurgle. I got completely fizzingly drunk and this whole chain of events began to rattle. Why would anyone set out to break the heart of someone he loved? Why would anyone intentionally cause that kind of pain?<br> Why did people kill each other?<br> Because they enjoyed it. Was it really that simple? To achieve a soul-shattering, it is better if the perpetrator has been through the same experience. Hurt people hurt people more skillfully. An expert heartbreaker knows the effect of each incision. The blade slips in barely noticed, the pain and the apology delivered at the same time.</p><h2>Even More Remarkable Names</h2><p>Immaculate Conception Finkelstein, Bosco Moo, and Vernal Equinox Grossnickel are among the hilariously unlikely but real names of real people brought together in a work accented with the drawings of Pierre Le-Tan</p><p></p><h2>Masterpieces of Illumination: Codices Illustres the World&#39;s Most Famous Illuminated Manuscripts 400 to 1600</h2><p>Famous Manuscripts - The fascinating world of medieval miniature painting and illumination</p><p>Famous Manuscripts: The fascinating world of medieval miniature painting and illumination From The Book of Kells to Boccaccio&#x2019;s Decameron and from the Vienna Genesis to Dante&#x2019;s Divine Comedy - see the breathtaking originals of 167 of the greatest classics of all time.

Or be charming and relaxed on a first date? What <i>is</i> it about a politician who seems wooden or a comedian whose jokes fall flat or an athlete who chokes? In all of these cases, striving seems to backfire. <br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Trying Not To Try, </i>Edward Slingerland explains why we find spontaneity so elusive, and shows how early Chinese thought points the way to happier, more authentic lives. We&#x2019;ve long been told that the way to achieve our goals is through careful reasoning and conscious effort. But recent research suggests that many aspects of a satisfying life, like happiness and spontaneity, are best pursued indirectly. The early Chinese philosophers knew this, and they wrote extensively about an effortless way of being in the world, which they called <i>wu-wei</i> (ooo-way). They believed it was the source of all success in life, and they developed various strategies for getting it and hanging on to it. <br> &nbsp;<br> With clarity and wit, Slingerland introduces us to these thinkers and the marvelous characters in their texts, from the butcher whose blade glides effortlessly through an ox to the wood carver who sees his sculpture simply emerge from a solid block. Slingerland uncovers a direct line from <i>wu-wei</i> to the Force in Star Wars, explains why <i>wu-wei</i> is more powerful than flow, and tells us what it all means for getting a date. He also shows how new research reveals what&#x2019;s happening in the brain when we&#x2019;re in a state of <i>wu-wei</i>&#x2014;why it makes us happy and effective and trustworthy, and how it might have even made civilization possible. <br> &nbsp;<br> Through stories of mythical creatures and drunken cart riders, jazz musicians and Japanese motorcycle gangs, Slingerland effortlessly blends Eastern thought and cutting-edge science to show us how we can live more fulfilling lives. <i>Trying Not To Try</i> is mind-expanding and deeply pleasurable, the perfect antidote to our striving modern culture.</p><p><b>Edward Slingerland</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Asian Studies and Canada Research Chair in Chinese Thought and Embodied Cognition at the University of British Columbia.

The butcher has been called upon to play his part in a traditional religious ceremony involving the sacrifice of an ox, in a public space with the ruler and a large crowd looking on. This is a major religious event, and Butcher Ding is at center stage. The text is not specific, but we are probably witnessing a ceremony to consecrate a newly cast bronze bell. In this ritual, the still-smoking metal is brought fresh from the foundry and cooled with the blood of a sacrificial animal--a procedure that demands precise timing and perfectly smooth execution.<br><br>Butcher Ding is up to the task, dismembering the massive animal with effortless grace: &#x201c;At every touch of his hand, every bending of his shoulder, every step of his feet, every thrust of his knee--swish! swoosh! He guided his blade along with a whoosh, and all was in perfect tune: one moment as if he were joining in the Dance of the Mulberry Grove, another as if he were performing in the Jingshou Symphony.&#x201d; The Dance of the Mulberry Grove and the Jingshou Symphony were ancient, venerated art forms: Ding&#x2019;s body and blade move in such perfect harmony that a seemingly mundane task is turned into an artistic performance. Lord Wenhui is amazed and is moved to exclaim, &#x201c;Ah! How wonderful! Can skill really reach such heights?&#x201d; Butcher Ding puts down his cleaver and replies, &#x201c;What I, your humble servant, care about is the Way [Dao, &#x9053;], which goes beyond mere skill.&#x201d; He then launches into an explanation of what it feels like to perform in such a state of perfect ease:<br><br>When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole. And now--now I meet it with my spirit and don&#x2019;t look with my eyes. My senses and conscious awareness have shut down and my spiritual desires take me away. I follow the Heavenly pattern of the ox, thrusting into the big hollows, guiding the knife through the big openings, and adapting my motions to the fixed structure of the ox. In this way, I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.<br><br>The result is that Butcher Ding is not so much cutting up the ox as releasing its constituent parts, letting the razor-sharp edge of his cleaver move through the spaces between the bones and ligaments without encountering the slightest resistance:<br><br>A skilled butcher has to change his cleaver once a year, because he cuts; an ordinary butcher has to change his cleaver once a month, because he hacks. As for me, I have been using this particular cleaver for nineteen years now, and have cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet its edge is still as sharp as when it first came off the whetstone. Between the joints of the ox there is space, and the edge of the blade has no thickness; if you use that which has no thickness to pass through gaps where there is space, it&#x2019;s no problem, there&#x2019;s plenty of room to let your cleaver play. That&#x2019;s why, after nineteen years, the edge of my blade looks like it just came from the whetstone.<br><br>It is not all smooth sailing. Occasionally Butcher Ding&#x2019;s effortless dance is interrupted when he senses trouble, at which point his conscious mind seems to reengage a bit, although he still remains completely relaxed and open to the situation confronting him: &#x201c;Whenever I come to a knot, I see the difficulty ahead, become careful and alert, focus my vision, slow my movements, and move the blade with the greatest subtlety, so that the ox simply falls apart, like a clod of earth falling to the ground.&#x201d; Lord Wenhui clearly sees something in this account that goes far beyond simply cutting up oxen. &#x201c;Wonderful!&#x201d; he exclaims. &#x201c;From the words of Butcher Ding I&#x2019;ve learned how to live my life!&#x201d; This remark signals to us that we should be taking the story of the ox as a metaphor: we are Butcher Ding&#x2019;s blade, and the bones and ligaments of the ox are the barriers and obstacles that we face in life. Just as Butcher Ding&#x2019;s blade remains razor-sharp because it never touches a bone or ligament--moving only through the gaps in between--so does the wu-wei person move only through the open spaces in life, avoiding the difficulties that damage one&#x2019;s spirit and wear out one&#x2019;s body. This is a metaphor that has not lost any of its power. I, for one, can attest that, after forty-odd years of sometimes hard living, my own blade feels a bit nicked and dull.<br><br>Another of my favorite portrayals of wu-wei also concerns an artisan. A woodcarver named Qing has received commissions to carve massive wooden stands for sets of bronze bells--precisely the sort of bells that were consecrated in Butcher Ding&#x2019;s ritual sacrifice. Again, this is high-stakes public art, commissioned by the ruler himself, and involving the promise of a juicy monetary reward and official honors. As with Ding, Qing demonstrates almost supernatural skill: the bell stands that he produces are so exquisite that people think they must be the work of ghosts or spirits. Like Butcher Ding, he is praised by his ruler, who exclaims, &#x201c;What technique allows you to produce something that beautiful?&#x201d; Again, like Ding, the woodcarver demurs, denying that what he does is all that special. &#x201c;I, your servant, am merely a humble artisan. What technique could I possibly possess?&#x201d; After being pressed a bit, though, he acknowledges that perhaps there is a secret to his success, having to do with how he prepares himself mentally to begin the work: &#x201c;When I am getting ready to make a bell stand, the most important thing is not to exhaust my energy [qi], so first I fast in order to still my mind. After I have fasted for three days, concerns about congratulations or praise, titles or stipends no longer trouble my mind. After five days, thoughts of blame or acclaim, skill or clumsiness have also left my mind. Finally, after fasting for seven days, I am so completely still that I forget that I have four limbs and a body.&#x201d; The idea of carving a bell stand without a sense of one&#x2019;s limbs or body might seem odd, but the point is that Qing has so focused his attention that all external considerations have fallen away. &#x201c;There is no more ruler or court,&#x201d; he explains, &#x201c;my skill is concentrated and all outside distractions disappear.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s ready to get to work.<br><br>Now I set off for the mountain forest to observe, one by one, the Heavenly nature of the trees. If I come across a tree of perfect shape and form, then I am able to see the completed bell stand already in it: all I have to do is apply my hand to the job and it&#x2019;s done. If a particular tree does not call to me, I simply move on. All that I am doing is allowing the Heavenly within me to match up with the Heavenly in the world--this is probably why people mistake my art for the work of the spirits!<br><br>It&#x2019;s striking how similar this story is to the lore surrounding a great public artist from an entirely different time and culture, Michelangelo. When questioned about his own apparently supernatural sculpting talents, he supposedly replied that, when given a commission, he simply waited until he found a piece of marble in which he could already see the sculpture. All he then had to do was cut away the stone that didn&#x2019;t belong. Here, as with Woodcarver Qing, there is a sense that the materials themselves dictate the artistic process. The artist&#x2019;s own contribution is portrayed as minimal, and the creative act is experienced as completely effortless.<br><br>The stories of Butcher Ding and Woodcarver Qing both come from a book called the Zhuangzi, one of the two Daoist works that we will be looking at, and the richest hunting ground for wu-wei stories among Warring States texts. Characterizations of wu-wei in the other of our early Daoist texts, the Laozi, take the form of concise, cryptic poems rather than stories--much of the book probably rhymed in the original Chinese pronunciation, which we can now only imprecisely reconstruct. A typically mysterious passage from the Laozi describing the &#x201c;Way of Heaven&#x201d; is clearly meant to provide a model for how a properly cultivated person should move through the world:<br><br>The Way of Heaven<br><br>Excels in overcoming, though it does not contend;<br><br>In responding, though it does not speak;<br><br>In spontaneously attracting, though it does not summon;<br><br>In planning for the future, though it is always relaxed.<br><br>The Net of Heaven covers all;<br><br>Although its mesh is wide, nothing ever slips through.<br><br>The &#x201c;wide mesh&#x201d; that nonetheless captures everything is reminiscent of the relaxed concentration of Butcher Ding or Woodcarver Qing: at ease and yet open, profoundly attuned to the environment. Unlike our Zhuangzian exemplars, however, who attain perfection only after long periods of training in particular skills, the Laozian sage attains wu-wei by not trying, by simply relaxing into some sort of preexisting harmony with nature:<br><br>Do not go out the door, and so understand the whole world;<br><br>Do not look out the window, and understand the Way of Heaven.<br><br>The farther you go, the less you know.<br><br>This is why the sage understands the world without going abroad,<br><br>Achieves clarity without having to look,<br><br>And attains success without trying.<br><br>These sorts of passages, where wu-wei is an explicit focus, are quite common throughout the Zhuangzi and the Laozi, which is why the concept of wu-wei is typically associated with Daoism.<br><br>What is less widely appreciated, however, is that the sort of effortless ease and unselfconsciousness that characterizes these Daoist accounts also plays a central role in early Confucianism. This may come as a surprise, because Confucianism is typically associated with hidebound traditionalism and stuffy ritual--both of which strike us as the opposite of wu-wei. It can&#x2019;t be denied that the Confucians do a lot to earn this reputation. In the early stages of training, an aspiring Confucian gentleman needs to memorize entire shelves of archaic texts, learn the precise angle at which to bow, and learn the length of the steps with which he is to enter a room. His sitting mat must always be perfectly straight. All of this rigor and restraint, however, is ultimately aimed at producing a cultivated, but nonetheless genuine, form of spontaneity. Indeed, the process of training is not considered complete until the individual has passed completely beyond the need for thought or effort.<br><br>Confucius himself, in a passage that serves as a wonderfully concise spiritual autobiography, portrays wu-wei as the goal for which he has spent his entire life striving: &#x201c;The Master said, &#x2018;At fifteen I set my mind upon learning; at thirty I took my place in society; at forty I became free of doubts; at fifty I understood Heaven&#x2019;s Mandate; at sixty my ear was attuned; and at seventy I could follow my heart&#x2019;s desires without transgressing the bounds of propriety.&#x2019; &#x201d; The phrase &#x201c;my ear was attuned&#x201d; literally means &#x201c;my ear flowed along / went with the flow&#x201d; and suggests that when hearing the teachings of the ancients Confucius immediately grasped and took joy in them. By age seventy, he had so internalized the Confucian Way that he could act upon whatever thought or desire popped into his head and yet still behave in a perfectly moral and exemplary fashion. The end result looks as effortless and unselfconscious as that of the Zhuangzian butcher or Laozian sage but is, in fact, the product of a lifelong process of training in traditional cultural forms.<br><br>Confucius&#x2019;s form of wu-wei--an effortless, unselfconscious but eminently cultured spontaneity--was inherited as an ideal by his two Warring States followers, Mencius and Xunzi, although they disagreed profoundly about what&#x2019;s required to reach this state. Mencius tried to split the difference, as it were, between the Daoists and Confucius by presenting wu-wei as the natural outgrowth of cultivating our nature. For him, morally proper wu-wei was like a sprout waiting to break through the ground, or a body prepared to move with a catchy beat. Xunzi, on the other hand, was unimpressed by the Daoist celebration of nature and returned to the model championed by Confucius, whereby wu-wei was the result of a lifetime of rigorous education. For Xunzi, &#x201c;not trying&#x201d; was neither easy nor fun: the perfection of form and emotion that finds its ideal expression in dance was, for him, a hard-won achievement resulting from years of difficult training and cultural learning. In any case, this preoccupation with how to cultivate wu-wei was at the center of early Chinese controversies about how to attain the good life. This is a conversation worth paying attention to, because it brings to the forefront ideas, like spontaneity and charisma, that have fallen through the cracks of our contemporary mind-set.<br><br>YOUR BRAIN ON WU-WEI<br><br>In the early Chinese accounts of wu-wei described above, a couple of features are immediately apparent. First, although there is only one Butcher Ding or Confucius in the world, these wu-wei exemplars experience themselves as split. They seem to feel a gap between an &#x201c;I&#x201d; (the locus of consciousness and personal identity) and various forces--spiritual desires, desires of the heart--that take over when they enter wu-wei. Wu-wei is characterized by an internal sense of effortlessness and unselfconsciousness, even though the person in wu-wei may actually be very active in the world. Someone or something else must be doing the work besides the conscious mind that we normally think of as &#x201c;us.&#x201d; Second, people in wu-wei are extremely effective: huge oxen fall apart with a few swipes of the blade, and complex social situations are negotiated with masterly aplomb. My guess is that we have all experienced this combination of effortlessness and effectiveness at some point in our lives. While we are completely absorbed in chopping and saut�ing, a complex dinner simply assembles itself before our eyes. Fully relaxed, we breeze through an important job interview without even noticing how well it&#x2019;s going. Our own experiences of the pleasure and power of spontaneity explain why these early Chinese stories are so appealing and also suggest that these thinkers were on to something important. Combining Chinese insights and modern science, we are now in a position to understand how such states can actually come about.<br><br>Colloquially, we often speak of ourselves as if we were split in two: &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t make myself get out of bed this morning,&#x201d; &#x201c;I had to force myself to be calm,&#x201d; &#x201c;I had to hold my tongue.&#x201d; Although we use such phrases all the time, if you think about them they&#x2019;re a bit weird. Who is the self who doesn&#x2019;t want to get out of bed, and what is its relationship to me? Does my tongue really have a will of its own, and how do I go about holding it? (And who am I if not my tongue?) Since there is always only one &#x201c;me&#x201d; involved, this split-self talk is clearly metaphorical rather than literal. At the same time, the fact that we fall back upon this kind of language so frequently means that it must reflect something important about our experience. And talk of split selves is certainly not limited to English: we can see it in many wu-wei stories from early China that involve a narrative &#x201c;I&#x201d; confronting a part of the self that is more or less autonomous.</p><h2>The Dark Night of the Soul and the Living Flame of Love: St. John of the Cross (Fount Classics Series)</h2><p>In 1564, St. John of the Cross, a Spanish mystic, was arrested and banished to a remote Andalusian monastery for his involvement in leading the Carmelite order to reform.

Hundreds of film stills, many in color, plus dialogue, quotations, and other sources add to and illustrate each chapter&#39;s overriding theme.</p><p>An engaging and lavishly illustrated look at American film, from the master director. Based on the scripts of two documentaries on American film by Scorsese and writer/director Wilson, this is less a history than a catalogue raisonn&#x201a; of the films that have shaped Scorsese's own works. He is a notoriously devoted film buff, and his knowledge of cinema is both encyclopedic and deeply, even humbly, practical: ``The more pictures I make, the more I realize that I really don't know. I'm always looking for something or someone that I can learn from.'' One of the rewards of this book is the number of filmmakers, such as Boetticher and Ulmer, and films, such as Silver Lode, that Scorsese retrieves from obscurity--the filmography at the end is not to be missed. As a director, he is understandably a strong proponent of the auteur theory and its emphasis on films as personal expressions. In fact, this book is organized around various modes and manners of directing, from the ``Director as Storyteller'' to the ``Director as Smuggler'' to the ``Director as Illusionist.'' Scorsese and Wilson's discussion of the difference between directors who worked subversively within the system (smugglers such as Fritz Lang) and those who worked against the system (iconoclasts such as Orson Welles) is particularly revealing, as is their analysis of the three uniquely American genres: musicals, Westerns, and gangster films. However, in line with this work's coffee table aspirations, Scorsese and Wilson often tend to favor ``let's go to the highlights'' film appreciation over rigorous film criticism. This book also suffers from its screenplay origins--it doesn't read nearly as well as it plays--but it is a worthy albeit idiosyncratic window on American film and its shaping influence on a major director. (Book-of-the-Month Club selection) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>An academically trained filmmaker (NYU film school) who is among today's most innovative directors, Scorsese presents an engrossing, idiosyncratic memoir of his experiences with motion pictures, including recollections of his first boyhood journeys to movie theaters and the impressions the films made on him. In analyzing American film since the silent era, he especially highlights Westerns, musicals, and gangster movies, genres that originated in America. As a freewheeling director who has shunned Hollywood, Scorsese is intrigued by maverick directors like Erich von Stroheim, who brought about their own downfall by bucking the system, as well as by the more effective iconoclasts who were able to produce great films while playing by the studios' rules. Though this volume is essentially the script of the successful 1995 TV series of the same name commissioned by the British Film Institute and later rebroadcast on PBS, and while the cinematic illustrations portrayed on the screen are obviously lost in book format, there is much here for the serious film student to consider.

Now Martini crafts yet another legal nail-biter featuring perennial favorite attorney Paul Madriani. <br><br> After a lawyer friend is killed along with his client in a hail of gunfire outside the federal courthouse in San Diego, Madriani takes on another client who he believes is involved at the edges of the double murder. He takes the case not to defend the man, but to find out who killed his friend and why. Madriani is tortured by questions of conflict, his duty to a client who may have killed his friend, and the need to know the truth, wondering whether he himself had been marked for death only to have a friend die in his place. Soon he is drawn into a vortex of crime that spans the Americas. <br><br> As he searches for the killer, Madriani rides the crest of a dangerous wave of international drug deals and people who murder for money. Suddenly he realizes it is not heroin or cocaine that resulted in the murder of his friend, but a priceless piece of pre-Columbian art-something so dazzling in the information it holds as to be one of the treasures of the ages. <br><br> In a quest that takes Madriani from California to Mexico and the Guatemalan border, he discovers that while the motive to kill may be driven by distant, exotic, and ancient artifacts, the killer, like a serpent, lies much closer at hand.</p><p>When Paul Madriani's old friend, flamboyant criminal-defense lawyer Nick Rush, is gunned down on the streets of San Diego along with a client, Madriani sets out to find the killer. He follows the trail through shady real-estate dealings, cross-border smuggling, political corruption, and a nasty fight between Rush's ex and his young trophy wife over a hefty life-insurance policy. Eventually the case leads Madriani to the Yucatan Peninsula near Canc�n, where the last third of the book takes place--a dandy locale for skullduggery, even if it does make you suspect that the author thought up the plot while vacationing there.<p> <i>The Arraignment</i> is marred by some sloppy, foggy-headed writing ("The neighborhood exudes the kind of aura picked up by a sixth sense that lingers and lifts the hair on the back of my neck"), and the plot, after its initial bang, sags for a while before it gets moving again. However, the sheer vigor of Martini's prose, his densely inventive plotting, and his sharply drawn characters carry you happily, tensely along. The book's action scenes--including a hand-to-hand fight in a shabby apartment and an unforgettable poolside shooting at a Canc�n resort--are told in fresh, vivid prose that unfolds with hypnotic clarity. And the denouement is great fun, although the complex plot takes a lot of explaining at the end. Martini's not perfect, but he's still one of the best legal/adventure thriller writers going. <i>--Nicholas H.

Clay Blair, a highly respected military writer, is credited with taking a close and blistering look at high-level defense policy and ground-level leadership of the U.S. Army. He supports his analysis with official records and interviews with participants as well as his own deep knowledge of Washington personalities and politics. Blair's book captures the intensity of the conflict through the eyes of senior officers, explaining defeats and victories from the perspective of the U.S. battalion, regiment, and division commanders responsible for the progress of the war. As a collective portrait of the American officer corps at war, the book is uniquely valuable. <p>Highly critical of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's leadership during the period, Blair also takes President Truman to task for his misjudgments and occasionally faults the conduct of corps and division commanders while offering unstinting praise for Gen.

His books are classics in the fields of inspiration and spirituality. Although best known for As a Man Thinketh, he authored several other books that deal with the power of thought including The Path to Prosperity, The Mastery of Destiny, The Way of Peace, and Entering the Kingdom.Literally a blueprint on living, this little gem serves as a course of action for approaching life in a meaningful manner. AS A MAN THINKETH contains practical philosophy for successful living, and has awakened millions to the discovery and perception of the truth <p> Weaving his way through the inner dynamics the human psyche, James Allen shows us what we already intuitively know: how changing ones' mind-set can improve one's circumstances - no matter how difficult. Written in a succinct, easy-to-digest style, AS A MAN THINKETH is a valuable tool for anyone serious about achieving a purpose-filled life.</p></p><h2>The Letters of Gustave Flaubert, 1830-1857</h2><p><p> Flaubert wrote to his mistress, Louise Colet: "An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere." In his books, Flaubert sought to observe that principle; but in his many impassioned letters he allowed his feelings to overflow, revealing himself in all of his human complexity. Sensuous, witty, exalted, ironic, grave, analytical, the letters illustrate the artist's life--and they trumpet his artistic opinions--in an outpouring of uninhibited eloquence. </p><p> An acknowledged master of translation, Francis Steegmuller has given us by far the most generous and varied selection of Flaubert's letters in English. He presents these with an engrossing narrative that places them in the context of the writer's life and times. We follow Flaubert through his unhappy years at law school, through his tumultuous affair with Louise Colet; we share his days and nights amid the temples and brothels of Egypt, then on to Palestine, Turkey, Greece, and Rome. And the letters chronicle one of the central events in literary history--the conception and composition of what has been called the first modern novel, <i>Madame Bovary</i>. Steegmuller's selection concludes with Flaubert's standing trial for immoral writing, <i>Madame Bovary</i>'s immediate popular success, and Baudelaire's celebration of its psychological and literary power. </p><p> Throughout this exposition in Flaubert's own words of his views on life, literature, and the passions, readers of his novels will be powerfully reminded of the fertility of his genius, and delighted by his poetic enthusiasm. "Let us sing to Apollo as in ancient days," he wrote to Louise Colet, "and breathe deeply of the fresh cold air of Parnassus; let us strum our guitars and clash our cymbals and whirl like dervishes in the eternal hubbub of forms and ideas!" </p><p> Flaubert's letters are documents of life and art; lovers of literature and of the literary adventure can rejoice in this edition. </p></p><p><b>Francis Steegmuller</b> is the author of more than twenty books and a recipient of numerous awards and honors. His translation of <i>Madame Bovary</i> is an acknowledged classic. In 1982 the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters awarded him its Gold Medal for Biography.An enchanting book, one that combines so happily the art of the biographer and the art of the translator--and Francis Steegmuller is a master of both.

How do you break the ice?</p> <p>There are five basic steps in starting conversation, which don't always occur in this order. <i>Establish eye contact and smile,</i> then follow this simple procedure.</p> <p></p> <blockquote> 1. <i>Risk versus rejection.</i> Be the first to say hello. <p>2. <i>Ritual questions.</i> Ask easy-to-answer questions about the situation or the other person.</p> <p>3. <i>Active listening.</i> Know what to say next by listening carefully for free information.</p> <p>4. <i>Seek information.</i> Ask information-seeking follow-up questions based on free information <i>you've just heard.</i></p> <p>5. <i>Self-disclosure.</i> Reveal plenty of your free information while asking questions that may interest you personally.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>1. Risk Versus Rejection</b></p> <p>It takes a certain amount of risk to begin a conversation with a stranger. Most shy people don't start conversations because they fear being rejected. Of course, this prevents them from reaching out to others. Remember that risk taking and rejection are part of life, and to be overly sensitive is counterproductive. And, anyway, what's so bad about being rejected by someone you don't even know?</p> <p><b>Change from Passive to Active</b></p> <p>Most shy people take the passive role when it comes to starting conversations. They wait and wait and wait, hoping someone will come along and start a conversation with them. If there are two shy people together, they're both waiting, both taking the passive role. If someone else by chance does start talking, the shy person is often so surprised, she doesn't know what to say.</p> <p>To get out of this "Catch-22," consciously change from the passive to the active role. Be the first to say hello and take the initiative to begin the conversation. Introduce yourself to people regularly and begin to share your ideas, feelings, opinions, and experiences. Look for familiar faces, and after saying hello, seek out other people's thoughts, views, interests, and knowledge. By initiating conversations, you'll get more positive responses, and your fear of rejection will lessen. In this way your risk taking can pay off in making new contacts and having more meaningful conversations.</p> <p>Another advantage of being the first to say hello is that it gives you the opportunity to guide the direction of the conversation, and gives the other person the impression that you are confident, friendly, and open. You are also complimenting the other person by showing a desire to start a conversation with him.</p> <p><b>Minimize Rejections -- Look for Receptivity</b></p> <p>The more you practice starting conversations, the better responses you will get. But, of course, there are going to be some rejections too. No one receives unanimous approval, so when you do get rejected, don't dwell on it. Instead, use it as a lesson and adjust your approach for next time.</p> <p>The best way to minimize rejection is to look for receptivity in those you approach. Try to be sensitive to "where others are at." Look for open arms, eye contact, and a smile. Look for people who are sending receptive signals through their body language, and when you feel the time is right, approach them in a friendly and direct way. For example, if you are at a party or dance, and would like to ask someone for a dance, then look to those who either are dancing or look like they want to dance. Wait for a new song to start playing, and then take the risk. Move closer to the person and establish eye contact, smile, and ask the person for a dance. Chances are she will feel flattered that you have noticed her and hopefully will accept your invitation. If, however, the answer is no, then accept it gracefully with a smile (like water off a duck's back), and ask someone else. Keep asking and you're bound to get an acceptance. The more you ask, the better you'll get at picking out people who will respond the way you want them to.</p> <p><b>How to Accept Rejections</b></p> <p>If you have been rejected many times in your life, then one more rejection isn't going to make much difference. If you're rejected, don't automatically assume it's your fault. The other person may have several reasons for not doing what you are asking him to do; none of it may have anything to do with you. Perhaps the person is busy or not feeling well or genuinely not interested in spending time with you. Rejections are a part of everyday life. Don't let them keep you from reaching out to others. When you begin to get encouraging responses, then you are on the right track. It's all a matter of numbers. Count the positive responses and forget about the rejections.</p> <p>This simple philosophy can help people who fear rejection. If you have only taken a few social risks and have been rejected once or twice, then those rejections loom very large in your life. If, on the other hand, you take more risks, and start conversations, you will receive a mixture of open and closed responses, and each rejection will become less and less meaningful. Focus on the positive responses, and you will get better at choosing receptive people.</p> <p>You really have very little to lose, and a lot to gain. Taking the risk to be the first to say hello isn't such a fearful step. When you take the active role, you are sending this message: "I'm friendly and willing to communicate if you are."</p> <p><b>2. Ask Easy-to-Answer Ritual Questions</b></p> <p>Ritual questions are easy-to-answer requests for information. Although basically requests for personal background or general information, they also convey this message: "I'm interested in getting to know you better."</p> <p><b>Breaking the Ice -- A Compliment or Comment Followed by a Ritual Question</b></p> <p>Ritual questions can be used to break the ice with someone you don't know and wish to speak to. The easiest way to start a conversation with a stranger is to employ one of the three following openings. First, notice something interesting about the person you wish to speak with and, in a friendly and sincere manner, offer a compliment. Quickly follow the compliment with a ritual question that is directly related to the compliment you just gave. The "opening line" might be: "That's a beautiful ring you're wearing! What kind of stone is it?" or "Say, you're a terrific skater! How did you learn to do all those tricks?"</p> <p>A second way to break the ice is to notice something that the person is carrying -- maybe a book, musical instrument, or a piece of sporting equipment. After establishing eye contact and smiling, ask a ritual question based on the object. For example, if you see someone carrying a tennis racket, you could say something like: "Excuse me, but could you recommend a good place to take tennis lessons?" or "Do you know a good place to play without having to wait for a court?" or "I notice you have a racket like the one I'm interested in buying. How do you like it?" or "I see you're a tennis player. I want to start playing. Can you recommend a good racket for a beginner?"</p> <p>If you see someone reading or carrying a book, you can ask how he likes it. If a person has a musical instrument, you can ask him what kind of music he plays, where he plays or studies, how long he has been playing, or how you might get involved. If you see someone taking photographs, you could ask him about the type of camera he has or if he is a professional or amateur photographer. These questions can be applied to almost any object a person is carrying. It is a safe and friendly way of showing someone you've noticed him, while breaking the ice and starting a conversation at the same time.</p> <p>A third way to break the ice and start a conversation is to make a comment or ask a question based on the situation. This can be a request for information like: "Say, excuse me, but I'm looking for an apartment in the neighborhood. Do you happen to know of any places that might be for rent?" Another common question might be: "I'm looking for a good place to eat nearby. Can you recommend a restaurant in the neighborhood?" If you see someone who looks like she needs some assistance, then offering to help is an excellent way to start a conversation. You might say: "You look a little lost. Are you looking for someplace in particular? I live in the neighborhood -- maybe I can help you."</p> <p>In addition to asking for or offering assistance, another way to start a conversation is to make comments based on what you observe. It is best to focus on the positive things you see rather than complaining about the negative. This way you can let others in on the way you see the world, and not get caught in a conversation of "Ain't it a shame!" If you happen to be standing in a movie line, you can comment on other films, or the most recent book you've read if you are browsing in a bookstore. A straight-forward comment you can make is: "I've seen you here before. Do you live or work around here?"</p> <p>Ritual questions are good for breaking the ice and starting a conversation. By looking for what people are involved in, you can easily focus on a topic of interest to the other person. Remember, in addition to finding out about the other person, you are sending this signal: "You seem interesting to me, and I'd like to get to know you better!"</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>FAQ</b> <p><i>I dine at a local restaurant where I often see someone else who usually eats alone. How can I ask her if she wants to join me for dinner?</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Make an effort to be seated near the person dining alone, and when she looks in your direction, make eye contact, nod, and smile. If she smiles back, you can say, "Hello. I've noticed that you eat here a lot, too. What's for dinner tonight?" Remember that you are just showing interest and seeing if she ap...</p></p><h2>The Irda (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 2)</h2><p>In the Beginning . . .<br><br>Given life by gods, the Ogres were the most intelligent and beautful of the early races on Krynn, and they reigned supreme in their perfect kingdom . . .<br><br>Until that fabled race was weakened by clan rivalries and evil ambition, their downfall orchestrated by the hand of the Dark Queen, Takhisis . . .<br><br>Until the once-proud Ogres were cursed by their own mistakes and transformed into one of Krynn's most ugly, despised, and villainous species . . .<br><br>All except a small group, the Irda, who learned to accept goodness, fight for their freedom, and escape to build a utopian civilization of their own on a paradise island in the Dragon Isles.<br><br>The Irda<br><br>The Lost Histories Series probes the historical roots and epic struggles of the heretofore little-known peoples of Krynn.

In energetic prose, agricultural expert Evan D. G. Fraser and journalist Andrew Rimas tell gripping stories that capture the flavor of places as disparate as ancient Mesopotamia and imperial Britain, taking us from the first city in the once-thriving Fertile Crescent to today&#x2019;s overworked breadbaskets and rice bowls in the United States and China, showing just what food has meant to humanity. <br><br>Cities, culture, art, government, and religion are founded on the creation and exchange of food surpluses, complex societies built by shipping corn and wheat and rice up rivers and into the stewpots of history&#x2019;s generations. But eventually, inevitably, the crops fail, the fields erode, or the temperature drops, and the center of power shifts. Cultures descend into dark ages of poverty, famine, and war. It happened at the end of the Roman Empire, when slave plantations overworked Europe&#x2019;s and Egypt&#x2019;s soil and drained its vigor. It happened to the Mayans, who abandoned their great cities during centuries of drought. It happened in the fourteenth century, when medieval societies crashed in famine and plague, and again in the nineteenth century, when catastrophic colonial schemes plunged half the world into a poverty from which it has never recovered. And today, even though we live in an age of astounding agricultural productivity and genetically modified crops, our food supplies are once again in peril. <br><i><br>Empires of Food </i>brilliantly recounts the history of cyclic consumption, but it is also the story of the future; of, for example, how a shrimp boat hauling up an empty net in the Mekong Delta could spark a riot in the Caribbean. It tells what happens when a culture or nation runs out of food&#x2014;and shows us the face of the world turned hungry. The authors argue that neither local food movements nor free market economists will stave off the next crash, and they propose their own solutions. A fascinating, fresh history told through the prism of the dining table, <i>Empires of Food </i>offers a grand scope and a provocative analysis of the world today, indispensable in this time of global warming and food crises.</p><p><b>Evan Fraser</b> is an adjunct professor of geography at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada and a Senior Lecturer at the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds in the UK.

His work has frequently appeared in those publications, and in <i>The Boston Globe Magazine</i> and <i>The Boston Globe</i>."A panoramic overview of the vulnerability of global food networks to climate change....draws important lessons from the past....Though the topic is serious, the authors provide plenty of enlightening stories, including the adventures of a 16th-century Italian merchant who spent 15 years circumnavigating the globe, and the work of St. Benedict of Nursia, who established a network of monasteries that became "a nucleus of industry and food production," producing agricultural surpluses, creating commercial networks and promoting technological advances such as iron plows and the use of oxen. Spanning the whole of human civilization, this is a compelling read for foodies, environmentalists and social and economic historians." --<i>Kirkus</i><br><br>"With a flavor of Jared Diamond, <i>Empires of Food</i> thoughtfully weaves the religion, military history, and science into a historical arc of how food undergirds civilization's rise and fall.

Although the subject is serious, it is written in a compelling and readable style. While not pedantic or ponderous in any way, it is of impressive academic rigor.

Fraser and Rimas have a knack for the little detail that unveils the big thought. <i>Empires of Food</i> is a must-read for anyone who wants to know why every night a billion people got to bed obese and another billion go to bed hungry." <br> --George Alagiah, author of <i>A Passage To Africa </i>and <i>A Home From Home </i><br><br>"<i>Empires of Food</i> is a panoramic and prescient book which presents the challenges that civilizations have faced with agricultural production and societal fashions for food. The authors approach the issue with refreshing pragmatism and urge us to move towards a "glocal" approach to consumption norms. Their compelling narrative recognizes the value of efficient global food systems while also appreciating the importance of local connections to reduce ecological impacts. Such a vision for our palates holds much promise in balancing the debate on food ethics and sustainable development." <br> --Saleem H. Ali, author of <i>Treasures of the Earth: Need, Greed and a Sustainable Future</i><br><br>&#x201c;In offering a compelling portrait of the interplay between imperial expansion and food systems across the millennia, <i>Empires of Food</i> lays before us the fragility of a 21st century food system beset by climate change, rising fuel costs and a shrinking agricultural frontier and wonders whether, like the empires of the past, we will sustain a delusion of a superabundance as we careen toward a world of famine and insecurity or whether we will we find the wisdom and the means to avert catastrophe.&#x201d;<br> <br>--Raymond C. Offenheiser, President, Oxfam America<br><br>"Forget the old stages of human history, the familiar stone, bronze, iron age sequence: University of Guelph geographer Fraser and journalist co-author Rimas make a convincing case that food&#x2014;or rather, food surpluses&#x2014;best explain the rise and fall of civilizations. If cultures produce more than farmers eat, and find a way to store, transport and exchange that extra, then urban centres can flourish. Trouble is, food empires have always, so far, grown to the limits of their carrying capacity, hanging on precariously until the weather changes or pests strike, and the whole thing collapses. It&#x2019;s happened everywhere, as Fraser and Rimas demonstrate in their entertaining tour of past disasters. And maybe it&#x2019;s happening again: in five of the past 10 years the world has eaten more than it has produced, causing us to draw down on our grain stocks. There may yet be a lot more food to wring out of technological progress; then again, there may not be." --<i>Mclean's</i><br><br>"This is a book with a big thesis and panorama. Whether writing about ancient Rome, the Mayans, China, or mediaeval Europe, 19th century Britain and 20th century USA, the authors draw us inexorably to question whether the 21st century globalizing food system is poised to be punished for forgetting the laws of ecology. Fraser and Rimas propose that seemingly impregnable societies can falter and fail if they ignore the sustainability of their food supplies." --Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy, City University, London</p><h2>When the Powers Fall: Reconciliation in the Healing of Nations</h2><p>Repressive authoritarian regimes are falling and fragile new democracies emerging around the globe. How are longstanding conflicts and deep divisions to be healed and enemies reconciled without breeding further injustices? To answer this question, Walter Wink here applies his compelling analysis of &#34;the Powers, &#34; as they appear in the New Testament, to the global scene. Surveying the wrenching religious and ethical dilemmas involved in transitions from despotism to democracy, Wink neatly summarizes key concepts from his Fortress Press trilogy on the Powers, including sections on &#34;Jesus against Domination&#34; and &#34;Nonviolence.&#34; He then shows how central concepts in the teaching of Jesus can clarify true and false ideas of forgiveness and reconciliation and apology - without sacrificing justice. The personal, political, and geopolitical pertinence of Wink&#39;s ideas shines in his discussion of specific situations in Africa and Latin America.</p><p><p><b>Walter Wink</b> was professor emeritus of biblical interpretation at Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City.

Anderson examines the American colonies&#x2019; campaign to bring Quebec into the Continental confederation and free the Canadians from British &#x201c;tyranny.&#x201d; This significant reassessment of a little-studied campaign examines developments on both sides of the border that rapidly proceeded from peaceful diplomatic overtures to a sizable armed intervention. The military narrative encompasses Richard Montgomery&#x2019;s plodding initial operations, Canadian partisan cooperation with officers like Ethan Allen, and the harrowing experiences of Benedict Arnold&#x2019;s Kennebec expedition, as well as the sudden collapse of British defenses that secured the bulk of the province for the rebel cause. The book provides new insight into both Montgomery&#x2019;s tragic Qu�bec City defeat and a small but highly significant loyalist uprising in the rural northern parishes that was suppressed by Arnold and his Canadian patriot allies. Anderson closely examines the evolving relationships between occupiers and occupied, showing how rapidly changing circumstances variously fostered cooperation and encouraged resistance among different Canadian elements. The book homes in on the key political and military factors that ultimately doomed America&#x2019;s first foreign war of liberation and resulted in the Continental Army&#x2019;s decisive expulsion from Canada on the eve of the Declaration of Independence. The first full treatment of this fascinating chapter in Revolutionary War history in over a century, Anderson&#x2019;s account is especially revealing in its presentation of contentious British rule in Quebec, and of Continental beliefs that Canadiens would greet the soldiers as liberators and allies in a common fight against the British yoke. This thoroughly researched and action-packed history will appeal to American and Canadian history buffs and military experts alike.</p><p>MARK R. ANDERSON is an independent historian and a retired U.S. Air Force officer who currently serves as a civilian military planner for the U.S. government. He earned his B.A. in history from Purdue University and his M.A. in military studies from American Military University.Independent scholar Anderson makes a significant contribution to a neglected aspect of the American Revolution in this comprehensive, well-written monograph. He describes the Quebec Campaign of 1775&#x2013;76 as the U.S.'s first war of liberation. The Canadians' correspondence with the Bostonians led to the United Colonies' decision to erect the glorious standard of American liberty in Canada. In the context of ongoing protests in Quebec against colonial policies, the movement needed only a few sparks... to ignite a rebellion. The ostensible liberators, including Benedict Arnold's small outfit, initially found the Quebecois ready to embrace the patriot cause. Montreal submitted quietly to the Americans, but they were unable to force or negotiate Quebec's surrender; the disastrous attack by the Americans on December 31, 1775, inspired resistance the Americans couldn't suppress or conciliate. Continental maladministration handicapped the emergence of effective civilian leadership, and Anderson's thorough description of the convoluted situation is a major strength of the book. While the main American force deteriorated in the face of Quebecois resistance, its Canadian supporters sought rural support, but their increasingly revolutionary approach generated progovernment insurrection instead. The arrival of a British relief force resulted in the subsequent abandonment of an invasion that the Continental Congress was unprepared to control, adequately guide, or properly support.

Navigating the increasingly complex crosscurrents of local government finance has become an essential skill for today&#39;s public administrator. The convergence of rising expectations from citizens and council members, anemic growth in revenue sources, and unfunded pensions now coming due has complicated the local manager&#39;s task of preparing a budget that balances revenues with expenditures. More fundamentally, today&#39;s managers must deliver services at a time when public confidence in government and its ability to perform have reached unparalleled lows. This book examines the issues that a local manager confronts in developing a budget- both the choice of public services and projects to provide, and the choice of revenue sources used to pay for them. When formulating a budget, the manager must balance what is economically best, politically expedient, and administratively possible. Because the manager must also respond to citizens&#39; perceptions of an issue, whatever their accuracy, this book also examines budgets in those terms. In a more general sense, effective leadership requires that the public administrator shape as well as follow public opinion. The recommendations made throughout this book are designed to enhance citizens&#39; confidence in the responsiveness and competence of local government leaders.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Photo Guide to Framing and Displaying Artwork: 500 Full-Color How-to Photos</h2><p><p>Step-by-step color photos for all areas of matting and framing; the information is complete, accurate, and up-to-date.

Though she leads a comfortable, well-appointed life, Anna is falling apart inside. Adrift and increasingly unable to connect with the emotionally unavailable Bruno or even with her own thoughts and feelings, Anna tries to rouse herself with new experiences: German language classes, Jungian analysis, and a series of sexual affairs she enters with an ease that surprises even her.<br><br> But Anna can&#x2019;t easily extract herself from these affairs. When she wants to end them, she finds it&#x2019;s difficult. Tensions escalate, and her lies start to spin out of control. Having crossed a moral threshold, Anna will discover where a woman goes when there is no going back.<br><br> Intimate, intense, and written with the precision of a Swiss Army knife, Jill Alexander Essbaum&#x2019;s debut novel is an unforgettable story of marriage, fidelity, sex, morality, and most especially self. Navigating the lines between lust and love, guilt and shame, excuses and reasons, Anna Benz is an electrifying heroine whose passions and choices readers will debate with recognition and fury. Her story reveals, with honesty and great beauty, how we create ourselves and how we lose ourselves and the sometimes disastrous choices we make to find ourselves.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Hausfrau<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Elegant . . .

Her descriptions&#x2014;from Anna's mundane trips through the market to her extracurricular erotic trysts&#x2014;are laced with poetic precision. Anna, an American, has found herself living in her Swiss husband's world of suburban Zurich. We travel with her as she fumbles to live up to all it means to be a good wife, mother, and daughter-in-law while she searches to understand something more and, maybe, somehow, to disrupt the everyday monotony. Flashbacks to the memories Anna allows us, along with poignant glimpses into her regular counseling sessions, are the only clues we are given to try to piece together what is truly going on inside Anna's mind. Where <i>Hausfrau</i> really catches you off guard is in the complete journey you find yourself haven taken at the end. I quickly found myself captivated and unable to step away from Anna&#x2019;s every day and as I read the last sentence of the book I was haunted. My thoughts travelled back through the story - the realizations settled in an amazement to all that had happened...and hadn't. Essbaum, in her crafting of <i>Hausfrau</i>, executes a story that's telling is just as artful as the story told... a quiet disruption that I still find myself thinking about weeks after reading. <i>&#x2013; Penny Mann</i></p><b>Jill Alexander Essbaum</b> is the author of several collections of poetry and her work has appeared in <i>The Best American Poetry,</i> as well as its sister anthology, <i>The Best American Erotic Poems, 1800-Present</i>.

A hundred years and a thousand songs later, this ordinary little murder had become a legend. This is the true story of what happened after Stagger Lee shot Billy. </li></ul></p><p>[R]emarkable....As a work of scholarship as well as a roaring good tale, Stagger Lee is one of the finest graphic novels of the year. (Grade: A) --Entertainment Weekly<br><br>This outstanding and well-researched historical fiction spins its own compelling version of the tale, focusing on Shelton's black lawyer, a young legal assistant, and a local piano player who writes a song based on current events. While recounting the circumstances of Stag's two trials involving racism, political corruption, prostitution, and drug abuse it masterfully interweaves flashbacks that reveal a possible motive for the killing and accounts of the various Stagger Lee songs, with some insightful commentary on how the legend has changed depending on the singer and the times. McCulloch creates convincing, multifaceted characters, and Hendrix's sepia-toned artwork is effectively realistic. With sex and mature situations, this is for adult collections. With historical notes and a list of Stagger Lee songs appended, this is strongly recommended. --Library Journal<br><br>Stagger Lee brilliantly puts the shooting in the context of the politics of the time (1895) and place (St. Louis), and puts the politics in the larger context of race. Most of the characters in Stagger Lee are historical, although McCulloch and Hendrix throw in an entirely fictional love story. It's great stuff. --Jon Carroll, San Francisco ChronicleTracing the factual origins of a legend that has undergone hundreds of permutations over the years, McCulloch and Hendrix blend a fictional narrative with a detailed look at the documented information and myths of Lee Shelton, or "Stagger Lee." Best known to today's audiences thanks to Lloyd Price's 1959 #1 hit recording, the tale is a prototype for the "gangsta" image in black American song-story, an archetype even presented as a Caucasian character when the story headed west in the late 19th century. The basic account revolves around a fatal dice game in which Lee shot and killed one Billy Lyons. McCulloch's script interweaves the recorded facts of the incident with close scrutiny of many of the song's versions and its changing significance as American society progressed, bolstering the cultural archeology with a fictional account of the political upheaval caused by the murderer's trial. McCulloch covers much territory, and sometimes loses its thread, but sharp dialogue and characterizations maintain interest. Hendrix's solid art captures the story with a documentary precision, making this worth a look for those with an interest in America's musical history. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sayers: Her Life and Soul</h2><p>Marking the centennial of her birth, a new look at the life and work of Dorothy L. Sayers uses private letters and photographs to create a portrait of the author who created aristocratic sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey and became a noted Christian scholar</p><p>An Italian scholar and translator, Barbara Reynolds completed the translation of Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy which Dorothy L. Sayers left unfinished when she died. Dr Reynolds has told the story of this collaboration in The Passionate Intellect: Dorothy L. Sayers&#39; Encounter with Dante. She has also translated Dante&#39;s La Vita Nuova and Ariosto&#39;s Orlando Furioso, and was the general editor of The Cambridge Italian Dictionary. More recently, Dr Reynolds founded the journal Seven, to which she has contributed articles on Dorothy L. Sayers. She is the President of the Dorothy L. Sayers Society, and has frequently lectured at the society&#39;s conferences. She is currently working on an edition of the Sayers letters, of which the first three volumes have now appeared.Another ``interim report'' on the life (1893-1957) of the creator of Lord Peter Wimsey and reluctant Christian apologist, by a longtime friend, completer of Sayers's translation of Dante and author of The Passionate Intellect: Dorothy L. Sayers' Encounter with Dante (1989- -not reviewed). The problem all Sayers's biographers face is to reconcile her early career as a pioneer and leading theorist of the formal detective story with the religious plays, essays, and lectures to which she committed her last 15 years. In the absence of a collected edition of Sayers's letters, Reynolds still tries to make Sayers speak for herself whenever possible by quoting letters, conversations, and passages from her voluminous writings. The result is a view of the writer that Sayers herself would likely have approved of: as a generous, fiercely intelligent woman whose cardinal passion, her intellectual ardor, led her from Oxford to the hand-to-mouth London bohemianism that spawned the inimitably foppish Wimsey and then, quite logically, to a defense of the writer's imagination (The Mind of the Maker) that set forth Sayers's understanding of the Trinity. Despite some stiffness in the early chapters, and a disinclination to criticize her subject even mildly, Reynolds captures the ardent nature that sustained Sayers through her unrequited love affairs, her pregnancy without marriage, her lifelong support of the son she never publicly acknowledged, and the writing she felt certain from the beginning was her vocation. It isn't until the popular Wimsey books are behind, though, that Reynolds's matching passion comes out--she calls The Mind of the Maker and The Man Born to Be King Sayers's ``two greatest works''--and the biography comes into its own, even though only a few years of Sayers's life remain before Reynolds encounters the preemptive shadow of her own earlier book. Best, then, on the later years--the years of her own friendship with Sayers--that Reynolds has already described so sympathetically. Fans of Lord Peter may feel let down.

Based on three years of participant observation research at an elementary school, <i>Bad Boys</i> offers a richly textured account of daily interactions between teachers and students to understand this serious problem. Ann Arnett Ferguson demonstrates how a group of eleven- and twelve-year-old males are identified by school personnel as "bound for jail" and how the youth construct a sense of self under such adverse circumstances. The author focuses on the perspective and voices of pre-adolescent African American boys. How does it feel to be labeled "unsalvageable" by your teacher? How does one endure school when the educators predict one's future as "a jail cell with your name on it?" Through interviews and participation with these youth in classrooms, playgrounds, movie theaters, and video arcades, the author explores what "getting into trouble" means for the boys themselves. She argues that rather than simply internalizing these labels, the boys look critically at schooling as they dispute and evaluate the meaning and motivation behind the labels that have been attached to them. Supplementing the perspectives of the boys with interviews with teachers, principals, truant officers, and relatives of the students, the author constructs a disturbing picture of how educators' beliefs in a "natural difference" of black children and the "criminal inclination" of black males shapes decisions that disproportionately single out black males as being "at risk" for failure and punishment.</p> <p><i>Bad Boys</i> is a powerful challenge to prevailing views on the problem of black males in our schools today. It will be of interest to educators, parents, and youth, and to all professionals and students in the fields of African-American studies, childhood studies, gender studies, juvenile studies, social work, and sociology, as well as anyone who is concerned about the way our schools are shaping the next generation of African American boys.</p> <p>Ann Arnett Ferguson is Assistant Professor of Afro-American Studies and Women's Studies, Smith College.</p></p><p><p><b>Ann&nbsp;Arnett Ferguson</b> is Assistant Professor of Afro-American Studies and Women's Studies, Smith College.</p></p><h2>History and Art of the American Gun</h2><p><p>Engravers and embellishers of arms are the stars of this loving tribute to the artistry of firearms.</p></p><p>R.

As I gather my documents just before setting out, I call the hospital to remind them I won&#x2019;t be in until the afternoon. Then I enter the subway and make my way over to Second Avenue and, without much trouble, find the consulate. It occupies several floors of a skyscraper. A windowless room on the eighth floor serves as the section for consular services. Most of the people there on the Monday morning of my visit are Nigerians, almost all of them middle-�aged. The men are bald, the women elaborately coiffed, and there are twice as many men as there are women. But there are also unexpected faces: a tall Italian-�looking man, a girl of East Asian origin, other Africans. Each person takes a number from a red machine as they enter the dingy room. The carpet is dirty, of the indeterminate color shared by all carpets in public places. A wall-�mounted television plays a news program through a haze of static. The news continues for a short while, then there is a broadcast of a football match between Enyimba and a Tunisian club. The people in the room fill out forms.<br><br>There are as many blue American passports in sight as green Nigerian ones. Most of the people can be set into one of three categories: new citizens of the United States, dual citizens of the United States and Nigeria, and citizens of Nigeria who are taking their American children home for the first time. I am one of the dual citizens, and I am there to have a new Nigerian passport issued. My number is called after twenty minutes. Approaching the window with my forms, I make the same supplicant gesture I have observed in others. The brusque young man seated behind the glass asks if I have the money order. No, I don&#x2019;t, I say. I had hoped cash would be acceptable. He points to a sign pasted on the glass: &#x201c;No cash please, money orders only.&#x201d; He has a name tag on. The fee for a new passport is eighty-�five dollars, as indicated on the website of the consulate, but it hadn&#x2019;t been clear that they don&#x2019;t accept cash. I leave the building, walk to Grand Central Terminal, fifteen minutes away, stand in line, purchase a money order, and walk the fifteen minutes back. It is cold outside. On my return some forty minutes later, the waiting room is full. I take a new number, make out the money order to the consulate, and wait.<br><br>A small group has gathered around the service window. One man begs audibly when he is told to come back at three to pick up his passport:<br><br>&#x2014;�Abdul, I have a flight at five, please now. I&#x2019;ve got to get back to Boston, please, can anything be done?<br><br>There is a wheedling tone in his voice, and the feeling of desperation one senses about him isn&#x2019;t helped by his dowdy appearance, brown polyester sweater and brown trousers. A stressed-�out man in stressed-�out clothes. Abdul speaks into the microphone:<br><br>&#x2014;�What can I do? The person who is supposed to sign it is not here. That&#x2019;s why I said come back at three.<br><br>&#x2014;�Look, look, that&#x2019;s my ticket. Abdul, come on now, just look at it. It says five o&#x2019;clock. I can&#x2019;t miss that flight. I just can&#x2019;t miss it.<br><br>The man continues to plead, thrusting a piece of paper under the glass. Abdul looks at the ticket with showy reluctance and, exasperated, speaks in low tones into the microphone.<br><br>&#x2014;�What can I do? The person is not here. Okay, please go and sit down. I&#x2019;ll see what can be done. But I can&#x2019;t promise anything.<br><br>The man slinks away, and immediately several others rise from their seats and jostle in front of the window, forms in hand.<br><br>&#x2014;�Please, I need mine quickly too. Abeg, just put it next to his.<br><br>Abdul ignores them and calls out the next number in the sequence. Some continue to pace near the window. Others retake their seats. One of them, a young man with a sky-�blue cap, rubs his eye repeatedly. An older man, seated a few rows ahead of me, puts his head into his hands and says out loud, to no one in particular:<br><br>&#x2014;�This should be a time of joy. You know? Going home should be a thing of joy.<br><br>Another man, sitting to my right, fills out forms for his children. He informs me that he recently had his passport reissued. I ask him how long it took.<br><br>&#x2014;�Well, normally, it&#x2019;s four weeks.<br><br>&#x2014;�Four weeks? I am traveling in less than three. The website assures applicants that passport processing takes only a week.<br><br>&#x2014;�It should, normally. But it doesn&#x2019;t. Or I should say, it does, but only if you pay the fee for &#x201c;expediting&#x201d; it. That&#x2019;s a fifty-�five-�dollar money order.<br><br>&#x2014;�There&#x2019;s nothing about that on the website.<br><br>&#x2014;�Of course not. But that&#x2019;s what I did, what I had to do. And I got mine in a week. Of course, the expediting fee is unofficial. They are crooks, you see, these people. They take the money order, which they don&#x2019;t give you a receipt for, and they deposit it in the account and they take out cash from the account. That&#x2019;s for their own pockets.<br><br>He makes a swift pulling motion with his hands, like someone opening a drawer. It is what I have dreaded: a direct run-�in with graft. I have mentally rehearsed a reaction for a possible encounter with such corruption at the airport in Lagos. But to walk in off a New York street and face a brazen demand for a bribe: that is a shock I am ill-�prepared for.<br><br>&#x2014;�Well, I&#x2019;ll insist on a receipt.<br><br>&#x2014;�Hey, hey, young guy, why trouble yourself? They&#x2019;ll take your money anyway, and they&#x2019;ll punish you by delaying your passport. Is that what you want? Aren&#x2019;t you more interested in getting your passport than in trying to prove a point?<br><br>Yes, but isn&#x2019;t it this casual complicity that has sunk our country so deep into its woes? The question, unspoken, hangs in the air between me and my interlocutor. It isn&#x2019;t until past eleven that my number is finally called. The story is exactly as he has put it to me. There is an expediting fee of fifty-�five dollars in addition to the actual eighty-�five dollars that the passport costs. The payment has to be in two separate money orders. I leave the building for the second time that morning, to go and buy another money order. I walk quickly, and am exhausted by the time I return at a quarter to twelve, fifteen minutes before the closing of the window. This time, I don&#x2019;t take a number. I barge my way to the window and submit my form with the required fees. Abdul tells me to pick my passport up in a week. He gives me a receipt only for the original fee. I take it mutely, fold it up, and put it in my pocket. On my way out, next to the elevators, there&#x2019;s a partially torn sign that reads: &#x201c;Help us fight corruption. If any employee of the Consulate asks you for a bribe or tip, please let us know.&#x201d;<br><br>There is no number or email address appended to the note. In other words, I can inform the consulate only through Abdul or one of his colleagues. And it&#x2019;s unlikely that they are the only ones on the take. Perhaps thirty or thirty-�five dollars of the &#x201c;expediting fee&#x201d; is going to someone over Abdul&#x2019;s head. I catch the look on Abdul&#x2019;s face as I exit the room. He is absorbed in assisting other applicants. It is a farce, given a sophisticated&#x2014;�&#x201c;no cash please&#x201d;&#x2014;�sheen.<br><br>Two<br><br>It is early evening when the aircraft approaches the low settlements outside the city. It drops gently and by degrees toward the earth, as if progressing down an unseen flight of stairs. The airport looks sullen from the tarmac. It is named for a dead general, and is all that is worst about the architecture of the seventies. With its shoddy white paint and endless rows of small windows, the main building resembles a low-�rent tenement. The Air France Airbus touches down and glides onto the tarmac. Relief enters the holds and cabin with the inward-�rushing air. Some of my fellow passengers break into applause. Soon, we are trooping out of the craft. A woman weighed down with bags tries to barge through the aisle. &#x201c;Wait for me,&#x201d; she cries out to her travel companion, loud enough for everyone to hear, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming.&#x201d; And I, too, experience the ecstasy of arrival, the irrational sense that all will now be well. Fifteen years is a long time to be away from home. It feels longer still because I left under a cloud.<br><br>Disembarkation, passport control, and baggage claim eat up more than an hour of our time. The sky outside fills with shadows. One man argues with a listless customs official about the inefficiency.<br><br>&#x2014;�This is an international airport. Things should be better run. Is this the impression visitors should have of our nation?<br><br>The official shrugs, and says that people like him should return home and make it better. While we wait for the luggage machine to disgorge the bags, a white man next to me makes small talk. He has a brogue, and I ask if he is Scottish. &#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; he says, and he informs me that he works on the rigs.<br><br>&#x2014;�Got drunk in Paris last night, and got robbed. Firkin&#x2019; frogs lifted me credit card. But the Champs-��lys�es was something! Aye, pissed out me mind. Skunk drunk.<br><br>He grins. His teeth are studded with metal. He wears an earring and sports a ginger-�tinged five-�o&#x2019;clock shadow. He is not Europe&#x2019;s finest, but he&#x2019;ll earn well here.<br><br>&#x2014;�Won&#x2019;t get a flight to Port Harcourt till tomorrow. Staying at the Sheraton tonight. That&#x2019;s where the air hostesses stay, if you get me drift.<br><br>I nod. My bags finally arrive, damp and streaked with dirt. I lift them onto a cart. On the way out, an official in mufti motions me to stop. He is seated to the side of the door, and doesn&#x2019;t really appear to have any actual function. He&#x2019;s just there. He asks if I am a student. Well, yes, sort of. I figure the lie will speed things along.<br><br>&#x2014;�Eh ehn, I thought so. You have that student look. And where do you study?<br><br>NYU, I say, the answer that would have been correct three years ago. He nods.<br><br>&#x2014;�Well, in New York, they spend dollars. You know, dollars.<br><br>A meaningless silence passes between us. Then, sotto voce, and in Yoruba, his demand:<br><br>&#x2014;�Ki le mu wa fun wa? What have you brought for me for Christmas? Because, you know, they spend dollars in New York.<br><br>I have brought only resolve. I ignore him and roll my bags out to where Aunty Folake and her driver wait for me. When we unlock from our embrace, there are tears in her eyes. A scene out of the prodigal son. She hugs me again and laughs heartily.<br><br>&#x2014;�You haven&#x2019;t changed at all! How is that possible?<br><br>Outside, the airport looks finer, more regal than it did on approach. The entrances are clogged with passengers&#x2019; relatives and, in far greater number, touts, hustlers, and all sorts of people who are there because they have nowhere else to be.<br><br>Three<br><br>on the way home from the airport, at the roundabout of Ikeja bus stop, where the late afternoon rush makes the traffic snarl, we come to a complete standstill. Not more than twenty yards away from us, under the overpass, two policemen bicker. &#x201c;Go away,&#x201d; one yells at his partner. &#x201c;Why you always dey stand here? Why you no go stand that side?&#x201d; He points to the far side of the roundabout. For a moment, it seems as if the other officer sees the sense in the suggestion, but he is slow about carrying it out because the disagreement has by now attracted stares from pedestrians. He is reluctant to lose face. Both men are slim and dark, in gray-�black uniforms, with machine guns slung over their shoulders. They stand confused and silent like a pair of actors who have forgotten their lines. A crowd of commuters gawks at them from a safe distance.<br><br>Aunty Folake explains what is going on. Policemen routinely stop drivers of commercial vehicles at this spot to demand a bribe. The officer being told off has drifted too close to his colleague&#x2019;s domain. Such clustering is bad for business: drivers get angry if they are charged twice. All this takes place under a billboard that reads &#x201c;Corruption Is Illegal: Do Not Give or Accept Bribes.&#x201d;<br><br>And how much of the government&#x2019;s money, I wonder, was siphoned off by the contractor who landed the contract for those billboards?<br><br>It is one thing to be told of the &#x201c;informal economy&#x201d; of Lagos, and quite another to see it in action. It puts pressure on everybody. Some fifteen minutes before we reached Ikeja bus stop, we had passed a toll gate on Airport Road. It, too, was in the shadow of a large billboard condemning corrupt practices and urging citizens to improve the country. The toll at the booth was set at two hundred naira: this was advertised and understood. However, enterprising drivers, such as ours, know that they can get through the toll gate if they pay just half of that. The catch is that the hundred naira they pay goes straight into the collector&#x2019;s purse. &#x201c;Two hundred you get ticket stub,&#x201d; our driver says, &#x201c;one hundred you get no ticket. What do I need ticket for? I don&#x2019;t need ticket!&#x201d; And in this way, thousands of cars over the course of a day would pay the toll at the informal rate, lining the pockets of the collectors and their superiors. The demand from the immigration officer, the Ikeja police, the toll booth story: I encounter three clear instances of official corruption within forty-�five minutes of leaving the airport.<br><br>Even before I get home that night, though, I see other ways of thinking about these exchanges of money. We stop at Ogba to buy bread. Ogba is some way past Ikeja, at the end of Agidingbi Road. On the way into the shop a doorman salutes us and holds the door open. When we leave the building a few minutes later, he follows us for twenty yards as we move toward the car, and asks for a tip. It is not a demand: it is soft. He does it with the gentleness of someone explaining something to a child.</p><h2>The Message in the Hollow Oak (Nancy Drew, Book 12)</h2><p>In the Canadian woods, Nancy protects her new property from a crooked real estate promoter.</p><p>Carolyn Keene is the author of the ever-popular Nancy Drew (All New) Girl Detective and Nancy Drew and the Clue Crew series.</p><h2>Natural Golf Swing</h2><p>If your golf game has been plagued by inconsistency and less-than-peak performance, you may be going against your "natural swing".

At dusk tonight, the Midsummer Eve festivities will begin -- a time of potent magic in the faery realm. But just what will take place remains a mystery, for every year young Sneezle has fallen asleep. Something wonderful will happen, he knows -- or perhaps something dreadful and strange, for the faeries have two sides to their natures. <br> <i>Something wonderful, something strange...</i>In this enchanting collaboration between renowned doll maker Wendy Froud and award-winning writer Terri Windling, Sneezle's Old Oak Wood comes vividly alive with the magical denizens of the faery kingdom: a fatherly old troll dispensing wisdom from deep in his burrow; faery godmothers washing fragile wings; Titania and Oberon, the great lovers who rule over this faery kingdom; and a host of piskies, pookas, enchanted beasts, and darker spirits. Filled with the mystery and wonder of the very best faery tales, this entrancing story sends our unlikely little hero, Sneezle, into the tangled heart of the forest in an effort to thwart a powerful plot that threatens the Old Oak Wood. <br> Can the faery kingdom be saved? Can an insignificant little creature like Sneezle succeed in a hero's quest? With dazzling charm and a magical touch that will appeal to readers of all ages, <i>A Midsummer Night's Faery Tale</i> shows us that a good heart can triumph over evil and that humble truths are more powerful than the most elegant artifice. <br> <i>A Midsummer Night's Faery Tale</i> is the result of a magical collaboration between the doll and puppet maker Wendy Froud and the award-winning author Terri Windling. The faery world they unveil here so vividly features images of Ms. Froud's handmade figures woven into an enchanting faery tale for all ages written by Ms. Windling.</p><p>Not once upon a time, but right now, in a British forest called Old Oak Wood, faeries frolic, invisible to those humans who choose not to believe in them. In <i>A Midsummer Night's Faery Tale</i>, doll maker Wendy Froud (best known for creating Yoda and other creatures for Muppet master Jim Henson) and award-winning fantasy author Terri Windling collaborate to tell the story of one of these elusive fellows, a young tree-root faery named Sneezle.

Meanwhile, the Faery Queen Titania is found asleep, victim of a powerful magic spell. The hopes of the faery kingdom ride on Sneezle's little shoulders!

Read her review of <em>Patti LuPone: A Memoir</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Patti's story had me from the moment I turned to page one of the prologue until the absolutely triumphant final chapter. The passion with which she writes about the theatre and her love of it found me, at various times, crying and laughing. I thoroughly enjoyed her backstage tales that were both victorious and horror-filled. The lady pulls no punches in describing her most humiliating moments, such as the backstabbing that unfortunately happens all too often in this business. She recreates her failures and even includes quotes from her worst reviews. She writes about her loves and losses without a tone of self-pity. The chapter about her struggles with bringing <em>Evita</em> to life gave me goose bumps. It was definitely not an easy journey. She persevered and that role made her a bona fide Broadway star. The chapter about the backstage goings on during the production of <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> are even more harrowing. The fact that she could take such slings and still remain standing is proof that this is a woman of great strength and grit...and <em>talent</em>. God gave her the gifts of being able to brilliantly bring characters to life onstage. She&#x2019;s a wonderful actress...and, oh yes, she can sing like nobody&#x2019;s business. This is a heartfelt memoir that exposes Patti&#x2019;s innermost feelings, fervor, temper, and humor. There&#x2019;s no "censorship." She tells it like it is, warts and all. And by the time I finished reading the last chapter, I found myself giving Patti a standing ovation in the privacy of my very own living room.</p>PATTI LuPONE swept the 2008 theater awards winning the Tony, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Awards for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance as Rose in the critically acclaimed Broadway production of the classic musical <i>Gypsy</i>.

Again and again in <i>The Bird Catcher</i>, she approaches experience with a kind of reasonable trepidation. Yet she always does what is necessary--as protagonist <i>and</i> poet--to elicit a spiritual insight. Braving the elements seems to be second nature to her. And in this volume, she's consumed by one element in particular: water. In "Separate in the Swim," for example, she can't resist the ocean's allure, despite her terror of "the aim of wave, the idea / that picks up the water / and throws it at the shore." Yet this terror is also a prelude to a vision of oneness: <blockquote> Each stroke starts a far drumming<br> clumping the kelp, helping<br> shells and rubbish decay into sand.<br><p> In this stretch of the Atlantic<br> the whole Atlantic operates.<br></p><p> As I ride, its broad cast evokes<br> my tiny unity, a pod, a person.<br></p><p> Thanks to the closure of skin<br> I'm forking the tune I'm part of<br> though my part is played moving<br> on a different instrument.<br> </p></blockquote> In every poem in the collection, Marie Ponsot functions as an explorer, relentlessly mapping one piece of <i>terra incognita</i> after another. A linguistic delight, <i>The Bird Catcher</i> is also an invitation to voyage into the inner and outer wilderness. <i>--Mark Rudman</i>"The poems reveal the moral drama enacted just beneath the surface of the natural world.

But that's not going to happen, not when he's on a case that may be too hot even for his unorthodox talents to handle.</p><p>A local millionaire and his wife are brutally murdered. Jennifer, their teenage child and sole heir; is the prime suspect -- and she's gone missing. Laying everything on the line, Beamon sets offon a trail that takes him from a remote survivalist's cabin in the Utah mountains, through the labyrinthine headquarters of a cultlike church, into the shadowy, interlocking boardrooms of a powerful high-tech communications empire.</p><p>Just when he thinks he's close to finding answers, Beamon discovers the killing of Jennifer's parents is far more sinister than even he could have guessed. Now he isn't just looking for a young girl -- he's got to stop a bizarre conspiracy that could bring America to its knees...</p></p><p>Take one outspoken, sloppy, slightly boozy FBI agent who's too smart for his own good (and never lets the reader forget it) and exile him to a field office in Arizona so he doesn't embarrass the Agency. Tie him to a short tether and bury him in paperwork. Add a double murder and a missing teenager; throw in a little New Age religion (but don't identify it as Scientology, or L. Ron Hubbard's legions will bury you in lawsuits) and you have Kyle Mills's second Mark Beamon thriller. A bit too smug to be likable, Beamon has the case totally figured out before anyone else has a clue. Shortly thereafter, he's pressured to shut down the investigation. When he persists in following a road that leads right to the front door of the powerful Church of the Evolution, he's suddenly targeted by the IRS, labeled a pedophile, and finally suspended. But with the help of an ex-member of the cult, an eager young agent, and a crusty old retired wire tapper, Beamon manages to track down the missing girl and put a crimp in the church's ambitious plans. These include a conspiracy to take over the nation's telecommunications infrastructure and extend the cult's hold over the movers and shakers of the country--including Beamon's boss and other FBI honchos. A tidy little millennial thriller with echoes of Waco, Ruby Ridge, and those comet-happy cultists in San Diego who followed their leader to a higher plane last summer, this should win Mills (author of <i>Rising Phoenix</i>) a legion of new fans. <i>--Jane Adams</i><blockquote>"A compulsive adventure. . . .Kyle Mills is a writer to watch!"<br>-- Tom Clancy</blockquote><p>Two short years ago a young unknown named Kyle Mills took the world of thriller fiction by storm.

It's one of the bloodiest, clumsiest crimes Special Agent Beamon has ever seen. The missing teenage daughter, Jennifer Davis, who stands to inherit everything, is the prime suspect. Did she and her rock star boyfriend fake her abduction?</p><p>The boyfriend has an alibi, and Beamon has a feeling. Something is not right about this case--something is definitely not "by the book." With his new assistant in tow,and his new girlfriend all but forgotten, Beamon follows a trail of faint clues and strong hunches that lead from a remote Unabomber cabin in the Utah mountains, through the labyrinthine headquarters of the cult-like Church of the Evolution, into the shadowy, interlocking boardrooms of a high-tech communications empire.</p><p>Beamon has tossed the book aside again, and Washington is furious; for the church has powerful friends, as do companies like Vericomm and TarroSoft. Then a bombshell is dropped. The "murder" of Jennifer's parents was a double suicide. But why? What did the Davises gain by killing themselves while their daughter watched?

Marsalis shows us how to listen to jazz, and through stories about his life and the lessons he has learned from other music greats, he reveals how the central ideas in jazz can influence the way people think and even how they behave with others, changing self, family, and community for the better. At the heart of jazz is the expression of personality and individuality, coupled with an ability to listen to and improvise with others. Jazz as an art--and as a way to move people and nations to higher ground--is at the core of this unique, illuminating, and inspiring book, a master class on jazz and life by a brilliant American artist. <br> <br> <strong>An Interview with Wynton Marsalis</strong> <br> <br> <b>Q: You&#x2019;re a musician and composer. Why did you write this book, which is about life and lots of other things besides jazz?</b> <br> A: When I first decided to become a musician, at the age of 12 or 13, I was inspired by my father, and by the New Orleans jazz tradition. I was under the impression that I had only to learn the fundamentals of music--rhythm, melody, harmony, texture--to progress as a musician. What I didn&#x2019;t know then was that over the next three decades, jazz music would teach me many significant things about living. This book grew out of ten years of conversatins with my friend Geoff Ward, and is my attempt to share some of it&#x2014;about how important it is to be yourself in the world, and at the same time create while respecting the creativity of others. <br> <br> <b>Q: What does the title of this book, <i>Moving to Higher Ground</i>, mean to you?</b> <br> A: Too often in life, petty squabbles and small-mindedness keep us from realizing a higher purpose. In jazz, that higher purpose is not theoretical: We want to sound good. And when we do, you can hear what it&#x2019;s like when people are really trying to get along. It&#x2019;s purely human: In Jazz, you can mess up and still come together, still move together to higher ground. The title means ascending through engagement. <br> <br> <b>Q: You suggest that the ideas at the heart of jazz can carry over into everyday life. How so?</b> <br> A: Let&#x2019;s take two ideas in jazz that are most central: swinging and the blues. <br> <br> Swinging is the art of negotiation with someone else, under the pressure of time. It shows you how opposites can come together, without compromising who they are. The one who plays the highest-sounding instrument in the rhythm section--the time-keeping cymbal--has to find a way of working with the one who plays the lowest instrument, the bass. And the bass player, who plays the softest instrument, has to find a way of working with the player of the loudest, the drums. To succeed, everybody has to have a very clear idea of the common goal: What exactly are we here to do? In jazz we know: swing. In life, if everyone involved can agree on a primary objective, a group can accomplish almost anything. <br> <br> The blues is many things--a musical form, a distinctive sound, a universal feeling--but above all, the blues is survival music. It&#x2019;s message is simple: things are never so bad that they can&#x2019;t get any better. It&#x2019;s about crying over something, actually wailing--and it&#x2019;s about coming back. The words may be sad but the dancing shuffle (the definitive rhythm of the blues) is always happy or heading toward happiness. The blues is about what is--and what is has demons and angels sitting at the same table. That&#x2019;s a bitter-sweet and realistic message about life that everybody needs, that everybody can hear and respond to. I&#x2019;ve heard people respond to it, all over the world. <br> <br> <b>Q: How do jazz principles apply to, say, holding a successful meeting?</b> <br> A: If you come to a meeting without an agenda it&#x2019;s probably not going to be a very good meeting. In jazz improvisation, the agenda is the form of the song. But an agenda alone doesn&#x2019;t guarantee success. If everybody feels free to participate, unexpected things are sure to come up and will have to be dealt with intelligently. That&#x2019;s true in jazz improvisation, too. Things are bound to come up. Some need to be discarded right away. Others need to be expounded upon. Anyone in the rhythm section playing along behind the soloist can decide, "Hey, we need to investigate this further." And the soloist can respond, "Yeah, let&#x2019;s go into that." It&#x2019;s a system of checks and balances, but what makes it work is the fact that everybody is listening and responding to what the soloist is saying without ever forgetting the agenda. That&#x2019;s a pretty good model for swinging, and for getting things done. <br> <br> <b>Q: How do jazz principles apply to a family?</b> <br> The central relationship on the bandstand is between the bass and the drums. They&#x2019;re opposites of volume and register. The drums are the loudest and the swung cymbal is the highest-pitched while the bass is the softest and lowest-pitched. In order to swing, the right-hand stroke on the cymbal must find the right-hand pluck of the bass on every beat. While it is impossible to line those beats up with metronomic perfection it is possible to achieve a perfect intent to be together. That&#x2019;s what you would like to see with a mama and a daddy. They represent gender opposites. While they try to come together to solve a problem we can go in the direction of a good time. When they don&#x2019;t--when one is too loud or the other is unyielding--it becomes a matter of endurance, not swinging. <br> <br> <b>Q: What can jazz teach us about our feelings and ourselves as individuals?</b> <br> A: We&#x2019;re all given the gift of creativity. It comes out in all kinds of ways--the way we talk or dress or cook or whistle. I remember when I was a kid my friends and I used to see who could cut grass in the most creative way. But many times young people are put down for having a gift or skill that doesn&#x2019;t fit with somebody else&#x2019;s idea of what he or she should do with their lives. Jazz is the opposite of that. It tells you, "That&#x2019;s you! Take pride in this thing. Express yourself. Your sound is unique. Work on it. Understand it." Often it teaches you to celebrate yourself. <br> <br> When we talk about expressing feelings in jazz, we mean spiritual feelings, empathetic feelings, feelings that are beyond thought. In jazz, musical ideas move too quickly for you to stop and analyze or to formulate a lie. By the time you think about it, that moment of music is long gone. Jazz teaches you to cherish how you feel in the moment. It puts a premium on having faith in the people you&#x2019;re playing with. Because the second you lose that faith and start to question what they&#x2019;re doing, the distraction takes your mind off the music and onto bad decisions that you will surely begin to make. The combination of emotional honesty and mutual trust that jazz demands can help you if applied to almost any field. <br> <br> <b>Q: How can jazz help you understand your own friends and family better?</b> <br> A: At first it may seem like a paradox, but jazz helps you understand other people by teaching you that you never really know anybody. When you play music with someone--even someone you think you know really well--they&#x2019;ll play things you don&#x2019;t expect and can&#x2019;t anticipate. You&#x2019;ll go in one direction, based on what you think is going to happen and they&#x2019;ll take a completely different path. Jazz lets people be free, and to surprise you--and them. It doesn&#x2019;t let you mail in your response or let you lump people into categories that turn out to be meaningless. <br> <br> It also shows you that people, even geniuses, evolve over time. The Duke Ellington who played in 1931 was very different from the Duke of 1961. So you learn to be patient with other people and respect the progress they&#x2019;ve made and are still capable of making. One of the biggest challenges in dealing with friends and family is communication and more communication. Jazz forces us to communicate with people while recognizing their objectives, and over objectives, and where we can come together. <br> <br> <b>Q: How is jazz related to America, the country that created it?</b> <br> A: This art form was created to explain who we are. We have rights and responsibilities in the music just as we do as citizens. The Constitution can be amended and songs can always be added to or changes. In jazz we place a premium on the individual&#x2019;s right to self-expression but we also insist on checks and balances between one person&#x2019;s rights infringing on another--the soloists and the rhythm section have to work things out together. Otherwise the piece is a mess. <br> <br> Jazz allows us to improvise, to negotiate with one another. It&#x2019;s the sound of many people coming together in one thing. You might be from Chicago and be Jewish but you can stand on this bandstand with a Creole from New Orleans and when both of y&#x2019;all play, you&#x2019;ll agree on what sounds good, and you&#x2019;ll agree on it because you both can hear it. It&#x2019;s democracy in action and it allows us, for all our faults, to see the success of our history. It tells us who we have been, who we are now, and who we can be in the future. <br> <br> <b>Q: Why is jazz especially relevant today?</b> <br> A: This country is looking for change. Just look at what&#x2019;s going on: An African American and a woman were leading contenders for the presidency; Big questions of race and identity; millions of brand-new voters turning out. Barack Obama carrying southern states in the primaries with a charismatic message of coming together. It&#x2019;s a different time in our country and I think it&#x2019;s the perfect time for this music. <br> <br> Now, jazz has always been timely because it deals with the timeless issues of people, and of our democracy. Louis Armstrong dealt with them. So did Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. But if you listen to political candidates today, they almost never talk about culture. It&#x2019;s never really been part of our national dialogue and it should be, because it&#x2019;s the best was for us actually to come together. We talk a lot about having national conversations and we&#x2019;ve tried legislating unity. But we need to understand that art can bring people who are different together. Jazz provides a context for all the experiences we as human beings share. <br> <br> The direction of our culture is ascendant. Jazz is a perfect embodiment of that. Jazz is ascendant. If we take a long view of the past 150 years, we won&#x2019;t come to the conclusion that things are getting worse. We still have problems of corruption and greed. Jazz can provide a good antidote for them, too. To maintain their integrity, musicians have had to make many decisions that placed substance over commercial success. Jazz musicians have always aspired to an almost Utopian vision of a country in which everybody would come together and swing. <br> <br> The contemporary excitement around empowering people is not new to jazz. Jazz is empowerment. Its first great achievement was to empower individual musicians to take part in the creative process through improvisation. Participation is essential to a healthy American democracy, and it&#x2019;s essential to America&#x2019;s greatest music, too. Everybody has to participate to make it sound good. Whether you&#x2019;re playing or listening, you have to be active. If you&#x2019;re just sitting there and waiting for something to happen, nothing will. I hope this book will empower as many people as possible to take part by showing how an understanding of jazz and its principles can change your life, and our lives together. <br> <br>Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, musician, educator, and composer, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and received his first trumpet from renowned musician Al Hirt at the age of six.

Before she wrote Happy Happy Clover, she created ten volumes of manga about her cat. That series is called Pukupuku Natural Circular Notice. In 2002, it won the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award for kid&#39;s manga. Happy Happy Clover isn&#39;t just a book, it&#39;s also an anime and a video game. In 2007, 26 episodes aired on Japanese TV. The Nintendo DS action video game came out in February 2008. But until someone translates them, you&#39;ll have to learn Japanese to understand what the characters are saying! Tatsuyama lives in Osaka, Japan.Clover and her bunny friends live in Crescent Forest, which is a happy place except when Clover&#x2019;s wild schemes get them all in trouble. Together, the fearless rabbits make new friends, learn about the secrets of their home, and discover the dangers of the outside world. VIZ&nbsp;Media is beginning to expand its manga offerings for younger children beyond media tie-in stories, and this sweet tale is a good start. As should be expected in a manga about bunny rabbits, the cuteness factor is very high, but Tatsuyama&#x2019;s tale only occasionally slips into &#x201c;let&#x2019;s learn a lesson&#x201d; mode. The art is clear and easy to follow, with the characters distinct enough to be able to keep them straight and the few scary moments appropriately creepy, but not over the top. Libraries looking for manga for elementary-age readers, as opposed to &#x201c;all-ages&#x201d; titles that are really more appealing to middle-school patrons, will be excited by this new offering and should expect requests for the second volume of Clover&#x2019;s adventures.

Time itself becomes a conveyor belt moving us continuously from one demand to the next and year-to-year. Holidays and Holy Nights offers an escape from the conveyor-belt life and introduces us to the cyclical and deeply spiritual Christian liturgical year. This joyous book "unpacks" theology to uncover the poetic, symbolic, folkloric, psychological, and mystical nature of the liturgical year. Moving through the four seasons, Hill discusses holidays such as the Feast of Michaelmas, Halloween, Advent, Christmas Eve, Easter Vigil, and the Transfiguration. After evoking the experience of the seasons/festivals, Hill shows how they developed in history, theology, and folklore. He then offers specific suggestions for participating more deeply in the seasons, for Christians and non-Christians alike. Holidays and Holy Nights is a guide for all spiritual seekers looking for ritual and a way to create sacred time&#x201d; in our own lives, inspiring us to practice festival as a form of high fun or reverential play.</p><p>Christopher Hill&#39;s work has appeared in publications including the Los Angeles Reader, Spin Magazine, Record Magazine, and The Rolling Stone Review. He has been a broadcast producer, rock critic, editor, communications director for the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee, and has taught adult enrichment courses for the University of Wisconsin. He is the recipient of an Episcopal Communicators Award and an Associated Church Press Award.Three of the 12 chapters of this illustrated guide deal with Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, while the others tackle different days of the Christian year, including Easter and Pentecost. Especially interesting are the chapters on various lesser-known holy days like Michaelmas, All Saints' Day, Candlemas, the Feast of St. Mary Magdalene and the Feast of the Transfiguration. Hill has his reasons for wanting to resurrect the rhythms of the liturgical calendar: "We are all Bob Cratchits these days, chained in our money-changing cubbyholes for hours that even Ebenezer Scrooge would hesitate to demand." This book is a call for experiencing sacred time, and recovering the drama of incarnation, liberation and rebirth. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pumpkin Circle: The Story of a Garden</h2><p>We can be sure of this: It's a circle without end.

This is the story of how he gains both more knowledge and power, and more self-control.</p></p><p><p>L. E. Modesitt, Jr. lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p>Chapter One&nbsp;Rahl stood on the port wing of the fast frigate&#x2019;s bridge, looking out at the seemingly endless gray-blue waters of the Eastern Ocean. Even in midocean, the early-fall air seemed hazy and cool, and the cloudless green-blue sky held a hint of silver. Below the iron decks, he could sense the controlled chaos of the boilers and engines of the E.S. Ascadya as she steamed northeast&#x2014;toward Recluce. He could also feel the latent chaos of the powder in the locked iron magazines below the forward gun turret with its twin guns.<br>He glanced toward the covered center of the bridge where Captain Jaracyn stood beside the officer of the day, both slightly back of the helmsman. Although the captain had been polite and courteous to both Rahl and Taryl&#x2014;particularly toward the older mage-guard&#x2014;Rahl could sense Jaracyn&#x2019;s distaste for his mission. As a fighting commander of the Hamorian Navy, the captain would have preferred a more active role in dealing with the rebellion in Merowey than to transport two mage-guard envoys to Nylan, even though the mission was designed to keep the black ships of Nylan from becoming involved in hostilities against the Emperor.<br>Rahl glanced back as the frigate pitched forward, slicing through a heavy swell that sent spray flying back from the bow. Two ratings in khaki trousers and collarless khaki shirts didn&#x2019;t even duck as the cool spray showered them.<br>Rahl couldn&#x2019;t help but shake his head at how his life had twisted since he&#x2019;d left Land&#x2019;s End more than a year before. He&#x2019;d been exiled from the north of Recluce to the Black City of Nylan, and from there to Hamor because he could not control his abilities with order. He&#x2019;d been drugged with nemysa to destroy his memory after he&#x2019;d discovered the thefts by the director of the Nylan Merchant Association, and ended up as laborer in the ironworks of Luba, where he&#x2019;d been rescued and trained by a self-exiled mage-guard&#x2014;Taryl&#x2014;who had once been the Emperor&#x2019;s Mage-Guard Triad. Then Rahl had been posted to Swartheld as a junior mage-guard, where he&#x2019;d uncovered the Jeranyi pirate plot to destroy the merchant sector of the harbor&#x2014;and killed his superior and destroyed the entire Nylan Merchant Association in the process of saving the rest of the merchant houses. As a result, he and Taryl were now being dispatched to Nylan to explain all that had happened.<br>Yet, because Rahl had not learned enough about handling order, he knew he could not return permanently to Nylan. After his exile from Nylan and the conditions set forth for his return, if it were not for Deybri, the healer whose image and warmth he could not forget, he would not have been looking forward to returning at all&#x2014;because he had little more control over his abilities to handle order than when he had been dispatched and because every time he thought about the events leading to his exile, he had to fight the anger and rage those memories sparked.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking somber,&#x201d; observed Taryl. The thin-faced and angular mage-guard stepped to the bridge railing inboard of where Rahl stood. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re concerned about the reception you might get?&#x201d;<br>Rahl nodded. He was concerned about two reactions&#x2014;that of the board of magisters in Nylan and that of Deybri.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an official envoy of the Emperor,&#x201d; Taryl said. &#x201c;The most they can do is tell you to depart once we&#x2019;ve delivered our messages.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re really the envoy, ser. You&#x2019;re a former Triad, and I still don&#x2019;t see why anyone really needed me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose Jyrolt told you about the Triad?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, ser. He didn&#x2019;t tell me much, except that all the rumors were wrong, and that I was to tell anyone who suggested such that they were.&#x201d;<br>Taryl shook his head. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t believe you. Rumors are far more attractive, as you will discover.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah . . . ser . . . you didn&#x2019;t say why anyone needs me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because, as I&#x2019;ve told you several times,&#x201d; Taryl replied patiently, &#x201c;they know who you are, and what you are, and they&#x2019;ll be able to tell that you&#x2019;re telling them the truth. Also, you&#x2019;re the only one alive who has firsthand knowledge about the way the managing director of the Nylan Merchant Association in Swartheld was linked to the Jeranyi.&#x201d;<br>Rahl supposed that was true, but what difference would it make? The magisters hadn&#x2019;t ever really listened to him before. Why would they now, especially since he was a mage-guard of Hamor?<br>&#x201c;The engineers aren&#x2019;t the Council of Recluce,&#x201d; Rahl pointed out.<br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Taryl smiled. &#x201c;But they are the real power on the isle. Most of the trade comes through Nylan. They have the only warships that can challenge Hamor. By dealing with the magisters of Nylan, we will foment a certain amount of internal unrest in Recluce. That may focus their interest internally, rather than on Hamor, because the Emperor is suggesting that the true power lies in Nylan and not at Land&#x2019;s End.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You said that Fairhaven might be aiding the rebels in Merowey. If that is so, why would Recluce want to get involved? They wouldn&#x2019;t want to do anything to help Fairhaven.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, they wouldn&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;re right about that. But . . .&#x201d; Taryl paused. &#x201c;If they thought that they could weaken us by restricting trade or some other means, they might. That&#x2019;s why we need to point out that the Jeranyi were behind the attack on Swartheld and that the Jeranyi were willing to sacrifice the Nylan Merchant Association and all its goods and revenues in order to strike at Hamor. That confirms the Jeranyi as an enemy of both Recluce and Hamor. That&#x2019;s also why the captain is making speed. We need to be the ones to explain what happened first, to show good faith and concern.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Council in Land&#x2019;s End has already declared the Jeranyi as an enemy and restricted trade,&#x201d; Rahl said. &#x201c;They did that more than a year ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But Nylan still trades with them, according to our people there. That embargo only applies north of the black wall.&#x201d;<br>Rahl hadn&#x2019;t known that.<br>&#x201c;Most trade comes through Nylan now, remember,&#x201d; added Taryl. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to make the Jeranyi role clear. I will tell them the truth. They will be skeptical, and they will ask you. You are to convey what you know completely truthfully. You will tell them exactly what happened, and you will also tell them that the Emperor will announce that the Jeranyi were acting to cripple trade in Swartheld, but that they were stopped before they could complete their efforts.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What if they ask about what I did?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You tell them. If you&#x2019;d done nothing, the merchant association still would have lost everything.&#x201d;<br>Rahl nodded. That was certainly true enough, but he wondered if the magisters would see it that way, and, even if they did, whether the traders would.<br>He put his hand on the bridge railing to steady himself as the frigate pitched forward slightly, then rolled a bit to starboard on the recovery before righting herself. His eyes took in the port lookout, standing at the outboard end of the bridge, five cubits beyond the two mages. The rating had not even budged while Rahl was grasping to keep his balance.<br>&#x201c;You had said that Swartheld would not be suitable for my further training, but you did not say what that training would be,&#x201d; Rahl finally ventured.<br>&#x201c;I did not,&#x201d; replied Taryl.<br>Rahl waited.<br>&#x201c;Most of the mage-guards one sees are white and handle chaos. I assume you have noticed this.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, ser.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The reason for that is obvious. They can deal with malefactors quickly, and the way in which they do also inspires fear and respect. One does not build a land on fear alone. Order is also required, but mastering order and understanding its uses takes far longer and much more work. In your case, because you are a natural ordermage, it will take even longer.<br>&#x201c;On our return, you and I, as well as a number of other ordermages, will be sent to Merowey and placed at the disposal of Marshal Charynat to assist him in dealing with the rebellion there.&#x201d; Taryl&#x2019;s lips curled into a wry smile. &#x201c;I am certain we will both learn a great deal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The rebellion is still continuing? Against the Emperor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is likely to continue for a considerable time,&#x201d; Taryl replied. &#x201c;It appears that the Emperor&#x2019;s elder brother is behind it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Elder brother?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All the Emperor&#x2019;s offspring are trained as leaders and administrators. Those who are unqualified are exiled. The one who succeeds is not necessarily the oldest, but the one in the bloodline who the Triad and the High Command feel is best qualified.&#x201d; The older mage laughed. &#x201c;There have been mistakes, but not so many as when the Emperor&#x2019;s successor was always the eldest son.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The older son was the administrator in Merowey?&#x201d; asked Rahl.<br>&#x201c;He still is, and he has trained and raised his own army.&#x201d;<br>The more Rahl learned about Hamor, the less he knew . . . or so it seemed.<br>He glanced out to the horizon. Even though there were no clouds in sight, he had the feeling that there would be storms ahead.<br>Excerpted from MAGE-GUARD OF HONOR by L.E. Modesitt, Jr.<br>Copyright � 2008 by L.E.

What makes this especially troubling and complicated for Omishito is that her beloved spiritual mentor, Ama, is the panther's murderer. At first, Omishito cannot fathom why Ama, a tribal elder who still practices the old powers, would commit this sacrilege and risk the wrath of her tribe and country. (Unlike the Tiaga tribe, the Florida panther is considered endangered and therefore federally protected.) Through seamless storytelling and expert scene building, Linda Hogan reveals the many-layered mysteries inherent in this novel (based on a true story) as well as the powerful forces that endanger Native Americans and the survival of their spirituality. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Linda Hogan is a Chickasaw poet, novelist, and essayist.

Original.</p><p>Amanda Holden has written more than fifty translations and texts for the opera, theater, and concert hall. She wrote the libretto for Mark Turnage's opera <i>The Silver Tassie</i> for which, with the composer, she received the Olivier Award for "outstanding achievement in opera" in 2001.In this update of her compact but thorough guide, first published in 1993, opera translator Holden casts her net to include operetta and musical theater. Ranging from opera's beginnings in the 16th century to ventures that premiered as late as the end of 2000, she offers about 850 articles arranged alphabetically by composer. A tenth of these articles are new, representing previously unexplored territory or operas that have appeared since the earlier title. Familiar operas are addressed, as are those on the fringes of the repertoire and contributions by composers probably recognized only in their homelands (e.g., C.L. Dieter, P. Hadjiev, and J. Ruzitska). Performers are, however, excluded. After giving biographical information and background on musical training, the book presents major operas individually in chronological order, offering text sources, premiere dates, character names with voice types, synopses, and some critical remarks. Following are discographical recommendations, sources for scores and occasionally libretti, and bibliographic citations. Other operas and related works are listed at the end of each article. The operas of key figures like Mozart, Verdi, Wagner, Richard Strauss, and Puccini receive separate treatment, while those of lesser-known creators or where opera was not necessarily a main focus are mentioned within the bio-musical sketch. Each entry is initialed by a leading music scholar or practitioner, often among the most highly regarded in their respective areas-chiefly British with a sprinkling of American and Canadian names. The scattered illustrations add interest, presenting either portraits of composers or scenes/costumes from operas, evoking a period or genre. There are useful indexes of librettists and titles, as well as a glossary and contributor biographies. This comprehensive title is highly recommended as an update to relevant portions of The New Grove Dictionary of Opera at a bargain price.<br><i>Barry Zaslow, Miami Univ.

Reprint.</p><p>C. J. Cherryh three-time winner of the coveted Hugo Award is one of today&#39;s best-selling and most critically acclaimed writers of science fiction and fantasy. The author of more than fifty novels, she makes her home in Spokane, Washington.Another adventure set in the medium-future universe of Rimrunners and Cyteen; here, the action takes place in the solar system's asteroid belt, where independent miners are slowly being squeezed out by the predatory mining consortium ASTEX. Prospecting partners Morrie Bird, the old hand who owns the ship, and young, hotheaded pilot Ben Pollard encounter a wrecked, tumbling ship and discover aboard a lone survivor, Dekker, babbling and traumatized by whatever happened to him and by the loss of his partner. Hoping for salvage rights, Ben and Bird tow the hulk back to Base, and turn Dekker over to the medics. But, despite company denials, soon it emerges that at least part of Dekker's wild claims (an unreported collision, claim-jumping, a sinister plot) are true. Then, Dekker's partner's body turns up, bizarrely flung into a recovery orbit along with ores mined from a huge rock the company maintains doesn't exist. Teaming up with influential female miners Meg and Sal, Bird, Ben, and Dekker contrive to blow the lid off a massive coverup that involves ASTEX and public figures as distant as the President of Earth. Taut, gripping, realistic work, with Cherryh taking a stab at character development, and bringing her agreeably complex plot to a satisfying if unsurprising conclusion. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Going beyond static moves, he emphasizes a dynamic style of movement for the greatest climbing efficiency--a style that makes the most of your strength and your time on the rock. </p><p>With an emphasis on safety and how to stay within your abilities, Luebben teaches how to evaluate potential hazards and then avoid them. Topics addressed include: risk management, face climbing, crack climbing, gear, knots, anchors, belaying, toproping, sport climbing, trad climbing, multi-pitch free climbs, rappelling, aid climbing, bouldering, training, and self-rescue.</p></p><p>We were sitting at the base of the Nautilus, a rock formation known for prickly off-width cracks in Wyoming's Vedauwoo, when Sylvia Luebben asked me if I would consider writing a new edition of her late husband Craig Luebben's Rock Climbing: Mastering Basic Skills. <br><br>A kaleidoscope of thoughts went through my mind as I considered her offer. I was honored that she would ask me. I was sad to think that Craig wasn't alive to do it himself. I was intimidated by the undertaking of trying to update an award-winning book. <br><br>As I sat there below the Nautilus, one of Craig's favorite rocks, his daughter Giulia was climbing a tricky 5.9, and my kids were playing around on the rock slabs at the base. Climbing is very much alive in our families, and while I've mostly stepped away from the big alpine due to the time away from the family, I go rock climbing a few times each week. Some people go to the gym, ride a bike, or do yoga. I climb.<br><br>I pondered the accident that killed Craig, an ice wall collapse in the North Cascades; the kind of accident that could happen while walking under an icy roof or driving a car across an avalanche zone. There is one big difference: our culture accepts the risk of walking under icy roofs and driving on wintery roads. <br><br>A couple of weeks later I told Sylvia I'd be honored to take on the new edition. My inspiration was partly his family's steadfast belief in the beauty of climbing, partly his and my friendship that took us up the first one-day winter ascent of the Diamond, up numerous first ascents in the Utah desert, and to China and Canada on ice climbing adventures, and partly a shared passion for showing others how fun it is to climb safe and strong.<br><br>I've been asked numerous times how I could continue climbing after losing a friend to the sport, and I'm sure people wonder how Craig's wife and daughter continue to climb after losing Craig. It's a good question, one I don't entirely know how to answer, but the best I can do to explain is that life is risky. Some people avoid nearly all risk. Some of them have high blood pressure. Some have strained relationships with their naturally risk-taking children. Some look back from old age with regrets about the things they didn't do when they were young. <br><br>To people like Craig and I, risk is part of life; it's how you manage the risk that matters. Rock climbing is the safest of the different genres of mountaineering, and modern climbing equipment and attentive technique make it quite reasonable to climb a hundred days a year for an entire lifetime and never have a serious accident. <br><br>In the end, that's what inspired me to pour my heart and soul into this new edition: Craig and I dedicated our lives to sharing the valuable methodology of calculated risk-taking. For much of our society, voluntary risk is a contradiction. For us, being bold while staying safe, teaching while learning, and taking risks while avoiding danger all make perfect sense - and those who have tied into a rope and discovered the beauty of climbing tend to agree.<br><br>I've climbed with many partners, including partners who were paraplegic, strong, weak, blind, obese, old, young, athletic, timid or fearless - and nearly every one of them found climbing to be one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives. <br><br>Perhaps my mountain guide father, Mike Donahue, put it best: "Life is not found by avoiding the doing; life is a mountain to be climbed."Craig Luebben has been guiding professionally for more than twenty years. The author of How to Rappel!, How to Ice climb!, and other titles, he has written for magazines including Climbing and Rock &amp; Ice. He has opened many new routes on four continents.

It includes not just India, but extends north to Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal and as far south as Sri Lanka, the island nation so devastated by the recent tsunami. For people who love food and cooking, this vast region is a source of infinite variety and eye-opening flavors. <br><br>Home cooks discover the Tibetan-influenced food of Nepal, the Southeast Asian tastes of Sri Lanka, the central Asian grilled meats and clay-oven breads of the northwest frontier, the vegetarian cooking of the Hindus of southern India and of the Jain people of Gujarat. It was just twenty years ago that cooks began to understand the relationships between the multifaceted cuisines of the Mediterranean; now we can begin to do the same with the foods of the Subcontinent.</p><p><p>Jeffrey Alford is a writer and photographer based primarily in northeast Thailand and Cambodia. He plants and harvests rice each year; helps raise frogs and several varieties of fish; and happily struggles along in three languages: Central Thai, Lao Isaan, and Northern Khmer. His forthcoming book, to be published in 2014, is tentatively titled <i>How Pea Cooks: Food and Life in a Thai-Khmer Village</i>. His earlier books, all co-written with Naomi Duguid, are <i>Flatbreads and Flavors;</i><i>HomeBaking; Seductions of Rice; Hot Sour Salty Sweet; Mangoes and Curry Leaves</i>; and <i>Beyond the Great Wall.</i> Jeffrey is currently developing a series of intensive culinary tours through northeastern Thailand and western Cambodia (the Angkor Wat area) under the name of Heritage Food Thailand.</p>There's a shared sensibility in the Subcontinent when it comes to matters of eating. People almost always eat using one hand (the right hand), and they very seldom use utensils. This may not sound like a big deal, but we think it is. Time after time we watch foreigners come to the Subcontinent and have a very difficult time at first, eating without utensils and using only one hand. But interestingly, almost everyone breaks through, and when they do, they are entirely converted. Eating by hand influences how food tastes and how we relate to it. It's so sensual, so direct. But when we go back home, no matter how hard we try to resist, out come the utensils. Eating is a very culture-bound tradition. <br><br>One of the great pleasures of eating in the Subcontinent is that styles of eating by hand differ from place to place. When northerners eat rice, they pick it up with the tips of their fingers and then use their thumb to push the small amount of rice into their mouth. In southern regions, people eat rice using the entire hand, forming a ball of rice (approximately the size of a golf ball) by gathering the rice into their palm, flicking the wrist sideways to shape it into a mass, and finally tossing the entire ball into their mouth. <br><br>As a foreigner, it's fun to watch and learn, to try to imitate (though a style doesn't come quickly). After a while, when you think you've got it down, the style itself feels somehow crucial to the food, as if that particular food has to be eaten in that particular way. And if you eat by hand, when you're finished with your meal, you still have tasty little bits on your fingers, and then later, even after you've washed your hands, there's a delicious aroma that lingers. As foreigners we find all this wonderfully addictive, and so we can only imagine how important it would feel if we'd been eating this same food in this same way all our lives, and how unsatisfying it would feel to eat with utensils.<br><b>Recipe: Sweet Yogurt Sundae with Saffron and Pistachios</b> <br><br>Yogurt makes a simple and attractive sweet course or cooling snack-treat. This version of sweetened yogurt from Bengal is called mishti doi, doi being Bengali for "yogurt." The yogurt drains for an hour to lose its bitter whey and to thicken a little, then it is blended with jaggery (palm or crude sugar) and flavorings. Use good whole-milk yogurt, preferably organic. Serve in small bowls or tall sundae glasses and top with pistachios, or with pomegranate seeds or chopped toasted almonds. <br>� Line a large sieve or colander with cheesecloth or coarse cotton.<br>� Wet the cloth with water, then place the sieve or colander over a bowl. Place the yogurt in the sieve to drain for 1 hour in the refrigerator.<br>� Turn the yogurt into a bowl and set aside. Use the whey for another purpose (it makes a refreshing drink and can also be used in place of lemon juice to curdle milk for making chhana and paneer), or discard.<br>� If using the saffron, lightly toast the strands in a small dry skillet over medium heat, until brittle. Add the milk and cardamom or nutmeg, or if not using saffron, heat the milk and cardamom in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer, and simmer briefly, until the cardamom releases its scent (and the optional saffron gives off its color). Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar or honey until dissolved.<br>� Whisk the mixture into the yogurt. Use a ladle to pour the yogurt into glasses or bowls. Top with a sprinkling of nuts or pomegranate seeds, and with a little more sugar if you wish.<br>� Serves 8</p><h2>Quilting 101: A beginners guide to quilting</h2><p>A thorough primer on the fundamental skills and techniques of quilting presents detailed, step-by-step instructions and photographs that take novice quilters through the process of designing a quilt, creating blocks, piecing a quilt together, and the finishing touches, with tips on selecting and preparing fabrics and a variety of creative quilting projects. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>The editors of Creative Publishing international have created dozens of best-selling titles in the fields of sewing, crafting, quilting, home repair, home improvement, home decor, and landscaping.</p><h2>All You Need Is Fudge (A Candy-coated Mystery)</h2><p>"Fun characters, quaint setting, mouth-watering recipes." --<i>RT Book Reviews</i><br><br>Fudge shop owner Allie McMurphy is making fudgie treats for the annual yacht race--but a killer's stirring up a batch of trouble. . .<br><br><b>Sailing Into Murder</b><br><br>The annual yacht race off the coast of Mackinac Island, Michigan, is a highlight of the summer season, and Allie is pulling out all the stops making chocolate centerpieces for the occasion.

Longtime readers will be happy to find the customary racetrack skullduggery, galvanized by some fascinating new elements. <p>The very opening of <i>Second Wind</i> signals something new, with Francis's protagonist, meteorologist Perry Stuart, fighting for his life as he flies through the eye of storm on Trox Island, a blighted place steeped in guano and harboring a nasty secret. "But now, as near dead as dammit, I tumbled like a rag-doll piece of flotsam in towering gale-driven seas that sucked unimaginable tons of water from the deeps ...." </p><p> When the reader encountered details of the racing world in Francis's earlier thrillers such as <i>Whip Hand</i> and <i>Reflex</i>, they had the satisfying ring of authenticity. The same is true in <i>Second Wind</i>--Stuart's character was developed with the help of BBC weatherman John Kettley. </p><p> Although this is a new venue for Francis, he still has a knack for quickening the reader's pulse with a few carefully chosen words: "Despair was too strong a word for it. Perhaps despondency was better. When they came for me, they came with guns." <i>--Barry Forshaw</i></p>The grand master of crime fiction gallops once again into the winner's circle with his extraordinary new novel, Second Wind.<br><br>The catastrophic power of a giant hurricane can raise coastal waves thirty feet high and blow through houses at devastating speeds. For TV meteorologist Perry Stuart, however, such predictions are generally hypothetical, as he chiefly predicts periods of English drizzle with bursts of heavier rain and sunshine to follow. Stuart's profound weather knowledge and accuracy has given him high status among forecasters, but no physical baptism by storm.<br><br>Not, that is, until a fellow forecaster offers him a Caribbean hurricane-chasing ride in a small airplane as a holiday diversion. But a frightening accident teaches Stuart more secrets than wind speeds...and back home in Enland he faces threats and danger as deadly as anything nature can evolve.<br><br>Dick Francis "has simply never failed. Every one of his opening sentences pulls the reader in and doesn't let go until the last, perfect word," according to the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i>. <i>Second Wind</i> may be his greatest triumph yet.</p><h2>The Owl Always Hunts at Night: A Novel</h2><p><b>The thrilling follow-up to Samuel Bj�rk&#x2019;s internationally bestselling <i>I'm Traveling Alone</i>, which <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> calls &#x201c;tense and smartly constructed&#x201d;</b>&nbsp;<br><br> When a troubled teenager disappears from an orphanage and is found murdered, her body arranged on a bed of feathers, veteran investigator Holger Munch and his team are called into the case.

An old, ramshackle shed, a small, forgotten cabin on the far side of the estate, but she had never seen it herself. They were awakened at six o&#x2019;clock in the morning every day and went to bed at nine o&#x2019;clock every night. Always the exact same routine, no variations, with only two fifteen-minute breaks from lessons, homework, yoga, laundry, and all the chores that had to be done. The little girl smiled at the sound of the crickets, and she felt the soft grass tickle her feet as she veered from the path and moved cautiously along the fence toward the place that she, in her mind&#x2019;s eye, had decided must be the likely location of the cabin. For some reason she was not scared. She felt almost light; the terror would not set in until later, but right now she felt happy, free as a bird, all alone with her thoughts in the beautiful forest that smelled so good. She smiled broadly and trailed her fingers over a plant that resembled a star; it was almost like being in one of the dreams she often had when the pills they were given weren&#x2019;t very strong. She ducked under a branch and didn&#x2019;t even jump when she heard rustling in the nearby bushes. Perhaps a ko- ala bear had ventured down from the trees. She giggled to herself and wondered what it would be like to pet a koala. She knew that they had sharp claws and that they were not cuddly at all, but she tried to imag- ine what it must feel like anyway, the fluffy warm fur between her fin- gers, the soft nose tickling her neck&#x2014;she almost forgot why she&#x2019; d come outside before she suddenly remembered and stopped in her tracks when the wall of the cabin came into view only a short distance ahead of her. The little girl tilted her head and studied the gray wooden boards. So it was true. There was a place in the forest. A place where you could hide. Be on your own. She crept cautiously closer to the hut and felt a delight- ful tingling under her skin as she approached the door.</i></p><p><i>The little girl did not know that the sight awaiting her would change her forever, that it would haunt her every single night for years to come, under the blanket on the hard sofa, on the plane crossing the globe after the police discovered the crying children, under the duvet in the soft bed in a new country where the sounds were different. She knew nothing about this as she reached out her hand toward the wooden handle and slowly opened the creaking door.</i></p><p><i>It was dark inside.

It was early October, &nbsp;and the cool Saturday sunshine bathed the land- scape around him in a pretty glow, soft rays falling across the red and yellow autumn leaves that would soon be shed to make way for winter.</p><p>Tom&nbsp; Petterson loved his job. Especially when he was able to work outdoors. He had been hired by Oslo and Akershus County to register findings of <i>Dracocephalum&#x2014;</i>or dragonhead, as it was also known&#x2014;a plant &nbsp;threatened &nbsp;by &nbsp;extinction &nbsp;but &nbsp;which&nbsp; &nbsp;grew &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;woodlands around Oslofjord. He had received a fresh tip-off about the location of some via his blog, and that was his task for today: log the number and exact location of newly discovered specimens of this very rare plant.</p><p>Dragonhead &nbsp;grew to a height of ten to fifteen centimeters &nbsp;and had blue, dark blue, or purple flowers, which would wither in the autumn, leaving behind a cluster of brown seeds reminiscent of a cereal grass. Not only was the plant rare, it was also home to the even rarer dragonhead sap beetle, a tiny metallic blue beetle that fed only on these flowers. <i>The miracles of nature, </i>Tom Petterson thought, and he could not help smiling as he left the path and followed the route along which an observant ama- teur biologist had sent him. Sometimes&#x2014;he &nbsp;never said it out loud, be- cause he&#x2019;d been brought up to believe that there was absolutely no God, his parents had been insistent on that, but even so&#x2014;he could not help but marvel at it: the wonder of creation. The delicate relationship between all things, from the smallest to the biggest. Birds flying south every autumn to nest, vast distances to the same place every year. The leaves changing color every autumn, turning the trees and the ground into a living work of art. No, he would never say it out loud, but the thought would often cross his mind.</p><p>He turned right between two tall spruces and followed a brook up toward the location where the plants were supposed &nbsp;to be, smiling to himself again.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Samuel Bjork</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He crossed the brook and came to a complete standstill when he heard rustling in the shrub in front of him. Petterson raised his cam- era, ready to shoot. A badger? Was that what he&#x2019;d heard? This shy ani- mal was nowhere near as common &nbsp;as people thought. A good picture of a badger would be great for his blog, and it would make a nice story&#x2014;some &nbsp;dragonheads &nbsp;and a badger, the perfect Saturday trip.

He pressed the red button and re- turned the phone to his pocket. Family time now. That was the mistake he&#x2019;d made a decade ago. He had not spent enough time with his family. He had worked &nbsp;around the clock, and even when he was at home, his mind had been on other things. Because of that he found himself out- side the house where Marianne now lived with another man.</p><p>Holger Munch scratched his beard and looked up in the rearview mirror at the big pink present with golden ribbons in the backseat. It was his granddaughter Marion&#x2019;s birthday. The six-year-old &nbsp;apple of his eye. The real reason he had agreed to drive up to R�a, although he&#x2019;d sworn &nbsp;never &nbsp;to set foot in the house &nbsp;ever again. Munch &nbsp;took a deep drag on his cigarette and realized he was rubbing his finger where his wedding ring used to be. He had worn it for ten years after the breakup, unable to make himself take it off. Marianne. She&#x2019;d been the love of his life. He had imagined that they would always be together, and he&#x2019;d not gone on a single date since the divorce. There were opportunities. It had never felt right. But he&#x2019;d done it now.

His first stop was the National Archives, where the immortal words from the Declaration of Independence that we &#34;are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights&#34; jumped off the page and into his heart. From day one in our country&#39;s history, the Author of freedom was not the state nor even the Founding Fathers. Our basic human rights and freedoms, which have been the spark for all of America&#39;s accomplishments and greatness, were - and are - &#34;Creator-endowed.&#34; Gingrich sounds a clarion call for us to recognize that the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness that we hold so dear are inseparable from a sincere and humble acknowledgement that these gifts are only the Creator&#39;s to give.</p><p>Newt Gingrich&nbsp;is best-known as the architect of the &#x201c;Contract with America.&#x201d; Under his leadership as Speaker of the House, Congress passed welfare reform, passed the first balanced budget in a generation, and passed the first tax cut in sixteen years.As an author, Newt has published eleven books, including the best sellers, <i>Contract with America</i> and <i>To Renew America</i>, and his most recent title, <i>Winning the Future: A 21st Century Contract with America</i>. In his post-Speaker role, Newt has become one of the most highly sought after public speakers, addressing prestigious organizations around the world. Mr. Gingrich, a regular contributor to the Fox News Channel, resides in Virginia with his wife, Callista. The Gingrich family includes two daughters, two sons-in-law, and two grandchildren.This short work, written by the former speaker of the House of Representatives and narrated jointly by him and his wife, argues against a purely secular interpretation of our nation's founding and history. They do this by taking a tour of the nation's capital and pointing out references to God in the writings of the Founders and on many of the buildings of Washington, DC. This work will probably not change many minds, but it does have some interesting points to make. Mr. Gingrich is a polished and experienced speaker who gives this production an easygoing and confident reading that is quite easy to follow. Mrs. Gingrich is not so polished, but she quickly warms up to the text.

He lives near Toronto.<b>PROLOGUE</b><p></p><p>It was just by chance he turned down Orchard Street and saw the window when he did. It easily could have been a week from now, or a month, even a year. But it turned out that this was going to be the day.</p><p>Sure, he would have wandered down here eventually. Sooner or later, when he got to a new city, he hit every street. He always started out intending to be methodical about it&#x2014;follow one street from beginning to end, then head over a block and backtrack on a parallel street, like doing the aisles in a grocery store&#x2014; but then he'd get to a cross street and something would catch his eye, and all good intentions would be abandoned.</p><p>That was how it turned out when he got to Manhattan, even though, of all the cities he'd visited, it was the one that most lent itself to being explored in an orderly fashion, at least those parts of the city north of Fourteenth Street, which was laid out in that perfect grid of streets and avenues. South of that, once you got into the West Village and Greenwich Village and SoHo and Chinatown, well, it was chaos down there, but that didn't bother him. It certainly wasn't any worse than in London or Rome or Paris or even Boston's North End, and he'd loved exploring those cities.</p><p>He'd turned south onto Orchard from Delancey, but his actual starting point for this stroll had been Spring and Mulberry. He'd gone south to Grand, west to Crosby, north back to Prince, east to Elizabeth, south to Kenmare, then east, continuing along Delancey, then, when he got to Orchard, decided to hang a right.</p><p>It was a beautiful street. Not in the sense that there were gardens and fountains and lush trees lining the sidewalk. Not beautiful like, say, Vaci Street in Budapest, or the Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris, or Lombard Street in San Francisco, but it was a street rich in texture and steeped in history. Narrow, one-way, running north. Old brick tenement buildings, few more than five stories, many only three or four, dating back a century and a half. A street that represented so many different times in the city's history. The buildings, with their skeletal fire escapes clinging to the fronts, reflected the Italianate style popular in the mid-to late nineteenth century, with arches above the windows, stone lintels projecting outward, ornate carved leaves in the trim work, but their ground floors housed everything from trendy caf�s to designer dress shops. There were older, more conventional businesses, too. A uniform shop, a real estate agent, a hair salon, a gallery, a place that sold luggage. Many of the closed stores were shielded with drawn-down steel doors.</p><p>He meandered down the center of the street, not particularly worried about traffic. It wasn't a problem right now. He always found you got the sense of a place by walking down the middle of the road. It offered the best vantage point. You could look ahead or from side to side, or whirl around 360 degrees and see where you'd been. It was good to know your surroundings and your options, in case you had to make a fast move.</p><p>Because the building blocks of a city were his primary concern&#x2014;its architecture, its layout, its infrastructure&#x2014;he paid little attention to the people he came across in his travels. He didn't strike up conversations. He wasn't interested in saying so much as hello to that redheaded woman standing on the corner, smoking a cigarette. He didn't care what kind of fashion statement she was trying to make with her leather jacket, short skirt, and what looked like deliberately laddered black tights. He wasn't going to ask the athletic-looking woman in the black baseball cap who was darting across the street in front of him how she thought the Yankees were going to do this year. He never watched baseball, and cared nothing about it. And he was not about to ask why a dozen people with guidebooks sticking out of their pockets were listening to one woman in the center of the group, although he guessed she was a tour guide of some sort.</p><p>When he got to Broome Street he spotted an inviting-looking restaurant on the southeast corner with small white tables and yellow plastic chairs set up on the sidewalk. But there was no one sitting outside. The sign in the window read: "Come in and get warm." He went up close, peering through the glass at the people drinking coffee, working on laptops, reading newspapers.</p><p>Reflected in the restaurant's window was that car he'd been seeing throughout his travels. Nondescript sedan. Maybe a Civic. With the apparatus on the roof. He'd seen the car before. Many times. If he didn't know better, he'd think it was following him. He put it out of his mind and looked through the glass, into the restaurant.</p><p>He wished it were possible for him to go inside and have a latte or a cappuccino. He could almost smell the coffee. But he had to keep going. So much of the world to see and so little time. Tomorrow he had plans to be in Montreal, and, depending how much ground he covered there, maybe Madrid the day after.</p><p>But he would remember this place. The sign in the window, the tables and chairs outside. The other businesses on Orchard. The narrow alleyways between the buildings. Plus everything that he had seen on Spring and Mulberry and Grand and Crosby and Prince and Elizabeth and Kenmare and Delancey.</p><p>He would remember it all.</p><p>He was about a third of the way down the block from the Broome cross street when he made that upward glance.</p><p>That was really where the element of chance entered into it. It wasn't at all remarkable that he ended up on Orchard. It was the fact that he looked above the storefronts. He didn't always do that. He scoped out the businesses and read the signs in their windows, studied the people in the coffee shops, made a mental note of the numbers above the doors, but he didn't always cast his eyes above the first or second floors. Sometimes he forgot, and sometimes he was short of time. He might easily have gone down this street and never glanced upon that particular window of that particular tenement building.</p><p>Then again, he thought, chance might have had nothing to do with it. Maybe he was meant to see this window. Maybe, in some strange way, it was a test. To determine whether he was ready, even though he believed he was. But those who would make use of his talents&#x2014;they might need some convincing before taking him on.</p><p>The window was on the third floor, above a place that sold cigarettes and newspapers&#x2014;there was that car again, reflected in the window&#x2014;and a second shop specializing in women's scarves. It was divided into two panes. An air-conditioning unit stuck out from the sill, taking up half of the lower pane. Something white, above the air conditioner, had caught his eye.</p><p>At first, it looked like one of those white Styrofoam heads department stores and hair salons use to display wigs. He thought, <i>Isn't that funny, to put one of those in a window</i>. A bald, featureless white head keeping watch over Orchard Street. He supposed that in New York you could find just about anything in someone's window. If it had been his, he would have at least put a pair of sunglasses on it, to give the head some personality. A hint of whimsy. Although, he had to admit, people did not tend to think of him as whimsical.</p><p>But the more he looked at it, the less sure he was that it was a white foam head. The surface appeared more shimmery, slippery even. Perhaps plastic, like the bags the grocery stores used, or a dry cleaning bag, but not one of the clear ones.</p><p>He attempted to get a better look, zero in.</p><p>The thing was, this white, almost circular object in the window still had the shape of a head. The plastic material strained against a protuberance that could only be a nose. It hugged tight across what appeared to be a brow near the top, a chin at the bottom. There was even a trace of mouth, the lips open as though gasping for air.</p><p>Or screaming.</p><p>It was, he thought, as though a white stocking had been pulled down over someone's head. But the material's sheen still made him think it was plastic.</p><p>That wasn't a very smart thing for someone to do. To put a plastic bag over their head. You could suffocate yourself doing something stupid like that.</p><p>A person would have to be pulling on the plastic bag, twisting it from behind, to make it conform so tightly to the contours of their face. But he didn't see this person's arms or hands doing anything like that.</p><p>Which made him wonder if someone else was doing it.</p><p>Oh. Oh, <i>no</i>.</p><p>Was that what he was witnessing? Someone putting a bag over another person's head? Cutting off their air supply? Smothering them? Could this account for the mouth that seemed to be struggling for air?</p><p>Who was this happening to? A man? A woman? And who was doing it to them?</p><p><i>Suddenly he was thinking about the boy in the window. A different window. Many years ago</i>.</p><p>But the person in this window, right now, didn't look like a boy, or a girl. This was an adult. An adult whose life was coming to an end. That certainly was how it looked to him. He felt his heart begin to beat more quickly. He'd seen things before on his travels. Things that weren't right. But they were minor compared to this. Never a murder. That's what he was sure this was.</p><p>He didn't shout out. He didn't reach into his jacket for a cell phone to call 911. He didn't spring into the nearest shop and tell someone to call the police. He didn't charge into the building and race up two flights of stairs in a bid to stop what was happening behind this third-floor window.</p><p>All he did was reach out, tentatively, as though it were possible to touch the smothered face of this person on the third floor, to feel what was wrapped around his or her head, make some sort of assessment as to&#x2014;</p><p><i>Knock knock</i>.</p><p>Then, maybe then, he'd have a better idea what was actually happening to this person in&#x2014;</p><p><i>Knock knock</i>.</p><p>He'd been so transfixed by what was happening at the window that he did not, at first, realize someone was trying to get his attention. Someone was at the door.</p><p>He took his hand off the mouse, spun around in his padded computer chair, and said, "Yes?" The door opened an inch. From the hallway, someone said, "Get your ass down for dinner, Thomas." "What are we having?" he asked. "Burgers. From the barbecue." The man sitting in the computer chair said flatly, "Okay."</p><p>He spun around and resumed looking at the frozen image of the window on his oversized computer monitor. The blurry, white, wrapped head suspended there. A ghostly visage.</p><p>Had anyone seen this at the time? Had anyone looked up?</p><p><i>No one had seen the boy when he was in the window. No one had looked up. No one had helped him</i>.</p><p>The man left the image on his screen so he could study it more closely when he came back up after dinner. Then he'd make a decision about what to do.</p><p></p><b>TWO WEEKS EARLIER</b><p></p><p></p><b>O N E</b><p></p><p>"COME on in, Ray."</p><p>Harry Peyton shook my hand and led me into his law office, pointing me toward the red leather chair opposite his desk. About the same age as my father, he looked years younger than Dad had. He was six feet, trim, with a head smooth as a melon. Baldness aged some guys, but not Harry. He was a long-distance runner, and his expensive suit fit him like a second skin. His desk was a testament to orderliness. A computer monitor, keyboard, one of the latest smartphones. And one legal file folder. The rest of the desk was as clean as a canvas before the first brushstroke.</p><p>"Again, I'm so sorry," Harry said. "There are a hundred things one could say about your dad, but Reverend Clayton summed it up nicely. Adam Kilbride was a good man."</p><p>I forced a smile. "Yeah, the minister did a pretty good job, considering he'd never met Dad. He wasn't much of a churchgoer. I guess we were lucky to find anyone to preside. Thanks for coming to the service. It almost got us up to a dozen."</p><p>Eleven people showed up for the funeral, and that was counting the minister and myself. There was Harry, and three of Dad's coworkers from the company he'd worked for, including his onetime boss, Len Prentice, and Len's wife, Marie. Also there were a friend of Dad's who ran a hardware store in Promise Falls before the Home Depot opened up outside of town and put him out of business, Dad's younger brother Ted and his wife, Roberta, from Cleveland, and a woman named Hannah whose last name I never got who lived just down the road from Dad. And there was a woman Thomas and I knew from high school, Julie McGill, who worked for the local paper, the <i>Promise Falls Standard</i>, and had written the story about Dad's accident. She hadn't come to report on the funeral&#x2014;how Dad died had made him a small news item, but he wasn't citizen of the year or head of the Rotary or anything. His service to the community was not newsworthy. Julie had come to pay her respects, simple as that.</p><p>The funeral home had a lot of egg salad sandwiches left over. They insisted I take some back to the house for my brother. I'd explained his absence by saying he wasn't feeling well, but no one, at least no one who knew my brother, believed it. I was tempted to pitch the sandwiches out the car window on the way home. Let the birds enjoy them, instead of my brother. But I didn't. I took them home, and they all got eaten.</p><p>"I'd hoped your brother might have come," Harry said. "It's been some time since I've seen him." At first I thought he meant to this meeting, which puzzled me, since my brother was not an executor. Then I realized Harry meant the funeral.</p><p>"Yeah, well, I gave it my best shot," I said. "He wasn't really sick."</p><p>"I figured."</p><p>"I tried to talk him into it, but it was pointless."</p><p>Peyton shook his head sympathetically. "Your father, he tried to do his best by him. Just like when your mother&#x2014;Rose, God bless her&#x2014;was still with us. How long's it been?"</p><p>"She passed away in 2005."</p><p>"After that, it must have been even more difficult for him."</p><p>"He was still with P&amp;L then," I said. Prentice and Long, the printers. "I think, maybe, after he took that early retirement not long after that, it got tougher. Being there, all the time. It got to him, but he wasn't the kind of man to run away from something." I bit my lip. "Mom, she found ways not to let it bother her, she had a way of accepting things, but it was tougher for Dad."</p><p>"Adam was a young man, really," Harry said. "Sixty-two, for Christ's sake. I was stunned when I heard."</p><p>"Yeah, well, me, too," I said. "I don't know how many times Mom told him, over the years, that cutting grass on that steep hill, on the lawn tractor, was dangerous. But he always insisted he knew what he was doing. Thing is, that part of the property, it's way back of the house you can't see it from the road or any of the neighbors' places. The ground slopes almost forty-five degrees down to the creek. Dad would mow along there sideways, leaning his body into the hill so the tractor wouldn't tip over."</p><p>"How long do they think your father was out there before they found him, Ray?"</p><p>"Dad probably went out to cut the grass after lunch, and wasn't discovered until nearly six. When the tractor flipped over on top of him, the ...</p></p><h2>An Autumn War (The Long Price Quartet)</h2><p><br><p>Daniel Abraham delighted fantasy readers with his brilliantly original and engaging first novel, and in his second penned a tragedy as darkly personal and violent as Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>King Lear</i>. Now he has written an epic fantasy of much wider scope and appeal that will thrill his fans and enthrall legions of new readers.</p><p>Otah Machi, ruler of the city of Machi, has tried for years to prepare his people for a future in which the magical <i>andat</i>, entities that support their commerce and intimidate all foes, can no longer be safely harnessed. But his efforts are too little, too late. The Galts, an expansionist empire from across the sea, have tired of games of political espionage and low-stakes sabotage. Their general, a ruthless veteran, has found a way to do what was thought impossible: neutralize the andat. </p><p>As the Galtic army advances, the Poets who control the andat wage their own battle to save their loved-ones and their nation. Failure seems inevitable, but success would end the Galtic threat. </p>With wonderful storytelling skill, Abraham has wedded the unique magic, high-stakes betrayal and political intrigue of his previous works with a broad tapestry of action in a spectacular fantasy epic.<br></p><p><br><p>Daniel Abraham won the International Horror Award for best short story. His previous novels include <i>A Shadow in Summer </i>and <i>A Betrayal in Winter, </i>the first two volumes of the Long Price Quartet, and the final book in the series, <i>The Price of Spring</i>.

The mornings were foggy, the afternoons chill. With the snowdrifts of winter almost all melted, the land around Machi became a soupy mud whose only virtue was the spring crop of wheat and snow peas it would bring forth. Travel was harder now even than in the deadly cold of deep winter.<br>And still, the travelers came.<br>&#x201c;With all respect, this exercise, as you call it, is ill-advised,&#x201d; the envoy said. His hands still held a pose of deference though the conversation had long since parted from civility. &#x201c;I am sure your intentions are entirely honorable, however it is the place of the Dai-kvo&#x2014;&#x201c;<br>&#x201c;If the Dai-kvo wants to rule Machi, tell him to come north,&#x201d; the Khai Machi snapped. &#x201c;He can pull my puppet strings from the next room. I&#x2019;ll make a bed for him.&#x201d;<br>The envoy&#x2019;s eyes went wide. He was a young man, and hadn&#x2019;t mastered the art of keeping his mind from showing on his face. Otah, the Khai Machi, waved away his own words and sighed. He had gone too far, and he knew it. Another few steps and they&#x2019;d be pointing at each other and yelling about which of them wanted to create the Third Empire. The truth was that he had ruled Machi these last fourteen years only by necessity. The prospect of uniting the cities of the Khaiem under his rule was about as enticing as scraping his skin off with a rock.<br>The audience was a private one, in a small room lined with richly carved blackwood, lit by candles that smelled like rich earth and vanilla, and set well away from the corridors and open gardens where servants and members of the utkhaiem might unintentionally overhear them. This wasn&#x2019;t business he cared to have shared over the dances and dinners of the court. Otah rose from his chair and walked to the window, forcing his temper back down. He opened the shutters, and the city stretched out before him, grand towers of stone stretching up toward the sky, and beyond them the wide plain to the south, green with the first crops of the spring. He pressed his frustration back into yoke.<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know that the Dai-kvo doesn&#x2019;t intend to dictate to me. Or any of the Khaiem. I appreciate your concern, but the creation of the guard isn&#x2019;t a threat. It&#x2019;s hardly an army, you know. A few hundred men trained up to maybe half the level of a Westlands garrison could hardly topple the world.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We are concerned for the stability of all the cities,&#x201d; the envoy said.&nbsp; &#x201c;When one of the Khaiem begins to study war, it puts all the others on edge.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hardly studying war to hand a few men knives and remind them which end&#x2019;s the handle.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than any of the Khaiem have done in the past hundred years. And you must see that you haven&#x2019;t made it your policy to ally yourself with . . . well, with anyone.&#x201d;<br>Well, this is going just as poorly as I expected, Otah thought.<br>&#x201c;I have a wife, thank you,&#x201d; Otah said, his manner cool. But the envoy had clearly reached the end of his patience. Hearing him stand, Otah turned. The young man&#x2019;s face was flushed, his hands folded into the sleeves of his brown poet&#x2019;s robes.<br>&#x201c;And if you were a shopkeeper, having a single woman would be admirable,&#x201d; the envoy said. &#x201c;But as the Khai Machi, turning away every woman who&#x2019;s offered to you is a pattern of insult. I can&#x2019;t be the first one to point this out. From the time you took the chair, you&#x2019;ve isolated yourself from the rest of the Khaiem, the great houses of the utkhaiem, the merchant houses. Everyone.&#x201d;<br>Otah ran through the thousand arguments and responses&#x2014;the treaties and trade agreements, the acceptance of servants and slaves, all of the ways in which he&#x2019;d tried to bind himself and Machi to the other cities. They wouldn&#x2019;t convince the envoy or his master, the Dai-kvo. They wanted blood&#x2014;his blood flowing in the veins of some boy child whose mother had come from south or east or west. They wanted to know that the Khai Yalakeht or Pathai or Tan-Sadar might be able to hope for a grandson on the black chair in Machi once Otah had died. His wife Kiyan was past the age to bear another child, but men could get children on younger women. For one of the Khaiem to have only two children, and both by the same woman&#x2014;and her a wayhouse keeper from Udun . . . They wanted sons from him, fathered on women who embodied wise political alliances. They wanted to preserve tradition, and they had two empires and nine generations of the Khaiate court life to back them. Despair settled on him like a thick winter cloak.<br>There was nothing to be gained. He knew all the reasons for all the choices he had made, and he could as easily explain them to a mine dog as to this proud young man who&#x2019;d traveled weeks for the privilege of taking him to task. Otah sighed, turned, and took a deeply formal pose of apology.<br>&#x201c;I have distracted you from your task, Athai-cha. That was not my intention. What was it again the Dai-kvo wished of me?&#x201d;<br>The envoy pressed his lips bloodless. They both knew the answer to the question, but Otah&#x2019;s feigned ignorance would force him to restate it. And the simple fact that Otah&#x2019;s bed habits were not mentioned would make his point for him. Etiquette was a terrible game.<br>&#x201c;The militia you have formed,&#x201d; the envoy said. &#x201c;The Dai-kvo would know your intention in creating it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I intend to send it to the Westlands. I intend it to take contracts with whatever forces there are acting in the best interests of all the cities of the Khaiem. I will be pleased to draft a letter saying so.&#x201d;<br>Otah smiled. The young poet&#x2019;s eyes flickered. As insults went, this was mild enough. Eventually, the poet&#x2019;s hands rose in a pose of gratitude.<br>&#x201c;There is one other thing, Most High,&#x201d; the envoy said. &#x201c;If you take any aggressive act against the interests of another of the Khaiem, the Dai-kvo will recall Cehmai and Stone-Made-Soft. If you take arms against them, he will allow the Khaiem to use their poets against you and your city.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Otah said. &#x201c;I understood that when I heard you&#x2019;d come. I am not acting against the Khaiem, but thank you for your time, Athai-cha. I will have a letter sewn and sealed for you by morning.&#x201d; <br>After the envoy had left, Otah sank into a chair and pressed the heels of his hands to his temples. Around him, the palace was quiet. He counted fifty breaths, then rose again, closed and latched the door, and turned back to the apparently empty room.<br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; he asked, and one of the panels in the corner swung open, exposing a tiny hidden chamber brilliantly designed for eavesdropping.<br>The man who sat in the listener&#x2019;s chair seemed both at ease and out of place. At ease because it was Sinja&#x2019;s nature to take the world lightly, and out of place because his suntanned skin and rough, stained leathers made him seem like a gardener on a chair of deep red velvet and silver pins fit for the head of a merchant house or a member of the utkhaiem. He rose and closed the panel behind him.<br>&#x201c;He seems a decent man,&#x201d; Sinja said. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want him on my side of a fight, though. Overconfident.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping it won&#x2019;t come to that,&#x201d; Otah said.<br>&#x201c;For a man who&#x2019;s convinced the world he&#x2019;s bent on war, you&#x2019;re a bit squeamish about violence.&#x201d;<br>Otah chuckled.<br>&#x201c;I think sending the Dai-kvo his messenger&#x2019;s head might not be the most convincing argument for my commitment to peace,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Excellent point,&#x201d; Sinja agreed as he poured himself a bowl of wine. &#x201c;But then you are training men to fight. It&#x2019;s a hard thing to preach peace and stability and also pay men to think what&#x2019;s the best way to disembowel someone with a spear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know it,&#x201d; Otah said, his voice dark as wet slate. &#x201c;Gods. You&#x2019;d think having total power over a city would give you more options, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>Otah sipped the wine. It was rich and astringent and fragrant of late summer, and it swirled in the bowl like a dark river. He felt old. Fourteen years he&#x2019;d spent trying to be what Machi needed him to be&#x2014; steward, manager, ruler, half-god, fuel for the gossip and backbiting of the court. Most of the time, he did well enough, but then something<br>like this would happen, and he would be sure again that the work was beyond him.<br>&#x201c;You could disband it,&#x201d; Sinja said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as though you need the extra trade.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about getting more silver,&#x201d; Otah said.<br>&#x201c;Then what&#x2019;s it about? You aren&#x2019;t actually planning to invade Cetani, are you? Because I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea.&#x201d;<br>Otah coughed out a laugh. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about being ready,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Every generation finds it harder to bind fresh andat. Every one that slips away becomes more difficult to capture. It can&#x2019;t go on forever. There will come a time that the poets fail, and we have to rely on something else.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Sinja said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re starting a militia so that someday, generations from now, when some Dai-kvo that hasn&#x2019;t been born yet doesn&#x2019;t manage to keep up to the standards of his forebears&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There will also be generations of soldiers ready to keep the cities safe.&#x201d;<br>Sinja scratched his belly and nodded.<br>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m wrong?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. I think you&#x2019;re wrong,&#x201d; Sinja said. &#x201c;I think you saw Seedless escape. I think you saw Saraykeht suffer the loss. You know that the Galts have ambitions, and that they&#x2019;ve put their hands into the affairs of the Khaiem more than once.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t make me wrong,&#x201d; Otah said, unable to keep the sudden anger from his voice. So many years had passed, and the memory of Saraykeht had not dimmed. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t there, Sinja-cha. You don&#x2019;t know how bad it was. That&#x2019;s mine. And if it lets me see farther than the Dai-kvo or the Khaiem&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible to look at the horizon so hard you trip over your feet,&#x201d; Sinja said, unfazed by Otah&#x2019;s heat. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t responsible for everything under the sky.&#x201d;<br>But I am responsible for that, Otah thought. He had never confessed his role in the fall of Saraykeht to Sinja, never told the story of the time he had killed a helpless man, of sparing an enemy and saving a friend. The danger and complexity and sorrow of that time had never entirely left him, but he could not call it regret.<br>&#x201c;You want to keep the future safe,&#x201d; Sinja said, breaking the silence, &#x201c;and I respect that. But you can&#x2019;t do it by shitting on the table right now. Alienating the Dai-kvo gains you nothing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What would you do, Sinja? If you were in my place, what would you do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Take as much gold as I could put on a fast cart, and live out my life in a beach hut on Bakta. But then I&#x2019;m not particularly reliable.&#x201d; He drained his bowl and put it down on the table, porcelain clicking softly on lacquered wood. &#x201c;What you should do is send us west.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But the men aren&#x2019;t ready&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re near enough. Without real experience, these poor bastards would protect you from a real army about as well as sending out all the dancing girls you could find. And now that I&#x2019;ve said it, girls might even slow them down longer.&#x201d;<br>Otah coughed a mirthless laugh. Sinja leaned forward, his eyes calm and steady.<br>&#x201c;Put us in the Westlands as a mercenary company,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It gives real weight to it when you tell the Dai-kvo that you&#x2019;re just looking for another way to make money if we&#x2019;re already walking away from our neighboring cities. The men will get experience; I&#x2019;ll be able to make contacts with other mercenaries, maybe even strike up alliances with some of the Wardens. You can even found your military tradition. But besides that, there are certain problems with training and arming men, and then not giving them any outlet.&#x201d;<br>Otah looked up, meeting Sinja&#x2019;s grim expression. <br>&#x201c;More trouble?&#x201d; Otah asked.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve whipped the men involved and paid reparations,&#x201d; Sinja said, &#x201c;but if the Dai-kvo doesn&#x2019;t like you putting together a militia, the fine people of Machi are getting impatient with having them. We&#x2019;re paying them to play at soldiers while everybody else&#x2019;s taxes buy their food and clothes.&#x201d;<br>Otah took a simple pose that acknowledged what Sinja said as truth.<br>&#x201c;Where would you take them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Annaster and Notting were on the edge of fighting last autumn. Something about the Warden of Annaster&#x2019;s son getting killed in a hunt. It&#x2019;s a long way south, but we&#x2019;re a small enough group to travel fast, and the passes cleared early this year. Even if nothing comes of it, there&#x2019;ll be keeps down there that want a garrison.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How long before you could go?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can have the men ready in two days if you&#x2019;ll send food carts out after us. A week if I have to stay to make the arrangements for the supplies.&#x201d;<br>Otah looked into Sinja&#x2019;s eyes. The years had whitened Sinja&#x2019;s temples but had made him no easier to read.<br>&#x201c;That seems fast,&#x201d; Otah said.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s already under way,&#x201d; Sinja replied, then seeing Otah&#x2019;s reaction, shrugged. &#x201c;It seemed likely.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Two days, then,&#x201d; Otah said. Sinja smiled, stood, took a rough pose that accepted the order, and turned to go. As he lifted the door&#x2019;s latch, Otah spoke again. &#x201c;Try not to get killed. Kiyan would take it amiss if I sent you off to die.&#x201d;<br>The captain paused in the open door. What had happened between Kiyan and Sinja&#x2014;the Khai Machi&#x2019;s first and only wife and the captain of his private armsmen&#x2014;had found its resolution on a snow-covered field ten years before. Sinja had done as Kiyan had asked him and the issue had ended there. Otah found that the anger and feelings of betrayal had thinned with time, leaving him more embarrassed than wrathful. That they were two men who loved the same woman was understood and unspoken. It wasn&#x2019;t comfortable ground for either of them.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep breathing, Otah-cha. You do the same.&#x201d;<br>The door closed softly behind him, and Otah took another sip of wine. It was fewer than a dozen breaths before a quiet scratching came at the door. Rising and straightening the folds of his robes, Otah prepared himself for the next appearance, the next performance in his ongoing, unending mummer&#x2019;s show. He pressed down a twinge of envy for Sinja and the men who would be slogging through cold mud and dirty snow. He told himself the journey only looked liberating to someone who was staying near a fire grate. He adopted a somber expression, held his body with the rigid grace expected of him, and called out for the servant to enter.<br>There was a meeting to take with House Daikani over a new mine they were proposing in the South. Mikah Radaani had also put a petition with the Master of Tides to schedule a meeting with the Khai Machi to discuss the prospect of resurrecting the summer fair in Amnat-Tan. And there was the letter to the Dai-kvo to compose, and a ceremony at the temple at moonrise at which his presence was required, and so on through the day and into the night. Otah listened patiently to the list of duties and obligations and tried not to feel haunted by the thought that sending the guard away had been the wrong thing to do. &nbsp;Eiah took a bite of the almond cake, wiping honey from her mouth with the back of her hand, and Maati was amazed again by how tall she&#x2019;d grown.

Whether it was the Bremen Literature Prize, the Grillparzer Prize, or the Austrian State Prize, his participation in the acceptance ceremony&#x2014;always less than gracious, it must be said&#x2014;resulted in scandal (only at the awarding of the prize from Austria&#x2019;s Federal Chamber of Commerce did Bernhard feel at home: he received that one, he said, in recognition of the great example he set for shopkeeping apprentices). And the remuneration connected with the prizes presented him with opportunities for adventure&#x2014;of the new-house and luxury-car variety. <br><br>Here is a portrait of the writer as a prizewinner: laconic, sardonic, and shaking his head with biting amusement at the world and at himself. A revelatory work of dazzling comedy, the pinnacle of Bernhardian art.</p><p>Thomas Bernhard was born in Holland in 1931 and grew up in Austria. The winner of the three most distinguished and coveted literary prizes awarded in Germany, he has become one of the most widely translated and admired writers of his generation. His novels published in English include <i>The Loser, Frost, Gargoyles,</i> <i>Correction,</i> and <i>Wittgenstein&#x2019;s Nephew</i>. The five segments of his memoir were published in one volume, <i>Gathering Evidence,</i> in 1985.

(The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The year 1874 saw the conclusion in London of a much publicized court case involving an unlikely pretender to an English baronetcy. Trollope responded to the public&#39;s interest in scandal with this novel, which traces the claim of a shadowy figure to the marquisate of Brotherton. The novel is full of sensational elements and is highly revealing of the social issues of the mid-1870s.</p><p>Anthony Trollope (24 April 1815 &#x2013; 6 December 1882) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era.

He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters.

Their destination, Amazonia&#x2015;the world&#x2019;s largest tropical forest with the greatest river system and richest ecosystem&#x2015;was then an almost-undiscovered environment to Western explorers and scientists.<br><br> In <em>Naturalists in Paradise</em>, Amazon expert John Hemming weaves the riveting stories of these three men&#x2019;s experiences in the Amazon and assesses their valuable research that drastically changed our conception of the natural world. Each of the three naturalists is famous for a particular discovery: Wallace is credited, along with Charles Darwin, for developing the theory of evolution; Bates uncovered the phenomenon of protective mimicry among insects; and Spruce transported the quinine-bearing Cinchona tree to India, saving countless lives from malaria. Drawing on the letters and books of the three naturalists, Hemming reaches beyond the well-known narratives, offering unrivaled insight into the often lawless frontier life in South America as seen through the lives of the great pioneers of modern disciplines: anthropology, tribal linguistics, archaeology, and every branch of natural science. 70 illustrations, 20 in color</p><p>Formerly the Director of the Royal Geographical Society in London, John Hemming has traveled in and written extensively about the Amazon region. His previous books include Tree of Rivers.&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine a better biographer for these three men than John Hemming. . . . [His] most evocative accounts concern the many indigenous peoples that the three explorers met. There is a great tenderness in his descriptions, mixed with an immense respect and appreciation for their customs and traditions. . . . <em>Naturalists in Paradise</em> is a story of adventure and tenacious endurance, told by an author who underpins the research with his personal knowledge of the Amazon.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The author of this most intriguing &#x2018;triography&#x2019; of Bates, Spruce and Wallace is the person best qualified to write it . . . Hemming&#x2019;s crowning achievement is the full integration of the stories of Bates, Spruce and Wallace. Wallace has been the focus of numerous books, while few narratives have concentrated on the great scientific contributions by Bates or Spruce. Hemming makes a very clear and compelling case that the other two&#x2019;s friendship, partnership, conversations, correspondence and research amply influenced Wallace&#x2019;s thinking and his great theory.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>Naturalists in Paradise</em>, John Hemming uses the stories of these three iconic Victorian explorers to show how the experience of being in the field is intensively individual and as idiosyncratic as the people themselves. There is no one better to explore their journeys than Hemming, who not only is a great scholar of the Amazon and its people but also has, himself, trodden in the footsteps of these men, a fact that allows him to empathize charmingly with their individual tales. Hemming portrays the personalities of each of these men brilliantly. . . . The most striking theme in Hemming&#x2019;s book is the powerful description of the importance of collaboration in field work and in science in general. . . . &nbsp;Today&#x2019;s scientists working with biodiversity and ecosystem services could take a cue from these Victorian naturalists who explored with both their eyes and minds open.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Science</em></strong></p><h2>Crafts and Skills of the Native Americans: Tipis, Canoes, Jewelry, Moccasins, and More</h2><p><i>Crafts and Skills of Native Americans</i> is a fascinating, practical guide to the skills that have made Native American famous worldwide as artisans and craftsmen.

The literary works within each section are an extension of these cookbooks, while the cookbook excerpts in turn become pieces of literature&#x2014;forms of storytelling and memory-making all their own. &nbsp; Each section offers a delectable assortment of poetry, prose, and essays, and the selections all include at least one tempting recipe to entice readers to&nbsp;cook&nbsp;this&nbsp;book. Including writing from such notables as Maya Angelou, James Beard, Alice B. Toklas, Sherman Alexie, Nora Ephron, M.F.K. Fisher, and Alice Waters, among many others,&nbsp;<em>Books That&nbsp;Cook</em>&nbsp;reveals the range of ways authors incorporate recipes&#x2014;whether the recipe flavors the story or the story serves to add spice to the recipe.&nbsp;<em>Books That&nbsp;Cook</em>&nbsp;is a collection to serve students and teachers of food studies as well as any epicure who enjoys a good meal alongside a good&nbsp;book. <p><br></p></p><p><p><strong>Melissa A.

He lives in California. <br> <br> Read on for Williams and Christopher Paolini's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br> <br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br> <br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one Of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br> <br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br> <br> That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <b> Read the full conversation </b>Christopher Paolini&#x2019;s abiding love of fantasy and science fiction inspired him to begin writing his debut novel, <i>Eragon, </i>when he graduated from high school at 15.

Certain the Toymaker is Greyfalcon, Jared&#39;s kidnapper, Dessa is determined to track him down and confront him about her brother&#39;s location. Meanwhile, Captain Drake has unintentionally stumbled upon Jared himself and decides to hold the boy as bait to lure Dessa to him.

The answer to that question is about to shock Drake --- and Jared!

M. Mooyaart [Jan 01, 1972] ...</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>Psychology and Christianity Integration: Seminal Works That Shaped the Movement</h2><p>Psychology and Christianity Integration: Seminal Works That Shaped the Movement</p><p></p><h2>Itch: The Explosive Adventures of an Element Hunter</h2><p>Thrills.

Dervla Murphy has also written &#34;In Ethiopia with a Mule&#34;, &#34;Muddling through in Madagascar&#34;, &#34;Eight Feet in the Andes&#34;, &#34;On a Shoestring to Coorg&#34;, &#34;The Waiting Land&#34; and &#34;Where the Indus is Young&#34;.</p><p>Dervla Murphy is one of the very best loved of travel writers. She was born in County Waterford and since 1964 has been regularly publishing accounts of her journeys - by bicycle and on foot -- in the remoter areas of four continents. She has also written about the problems of Northern Ireland, the hazards of nuclear power, and race relations in Britain. The Times Literary Supplement called her &#39;an admirable woman -- she has a romantic soul and a keen eye&#39;.This book recounts a trip, taken mostly on bicycle, by a gritty Irishwoman in 1963. Her route was through Yugoslavia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and ended in New Delhi. She carried a pistol, got sunstroke, and suffered the usual stomach disorders. She endured bad accommodations but reaped much local hospitality, too, including a dinner with the Pakistani president. Most of the book concerns the high mountain country of Afghanistan and Pakistan. First published in England in 1965, the book is neither current, nor quite old enough to be of much historical interest. Nonetheless, it is a spirited account, suitable for larger public library collections. Unfortunately, it lacks illustrations, and the two maps included give us little idea of the remote areas she visited. Harold M. Otness, Southern Oregon State Coll.

Like Cracker Jacks, there are surprises inside James Thurber's delicious 1945 smorgasbord of essays, stories, and sketches. This festival is, surprises and all, a collection of earlier collections (mostly), including, among others, gems from <i>My World--and Welcome to It</i>, <i>Let Your Mind Alone!</i>, and <i>The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze</i>. Needless to say, there are also numerous cartoons that, by themselves, are worth the price of admission. While redoubling Thurber's deserved reputation as a laugh-out-loud humorist and teller-of-gentle-tales, it reintroduces him as a thinker-of-thoughts. To wit: his 1933 "Preface to a Life," in which he observes himself while discussing "writers of light pieces running from a thousand to two thousand words": <blockquote> To call such persons "humorists," a loose-fitting and ugly word, is to miss the nature of their dilemma and the dilemma of their nature. The little wheels of their invention are set in motion by the damp hand of melancholy. </blockquote> Enjoy the surprises, certainly, but revel in the candy-coated popcorn and peanuts. As in "More Alarms at Night," in which a teenaged Thurber intrudes upon his sleeping father, a skittish man named Charles, because he can't recall the name Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Coincidentally, his father has just been frightened half to death by Thurber's brother, who had earlier stalked into his room saying coldly, "Buck, your time has come." <blockquote> "Listen," I said. "Name some towns in New Jersey quick!" It must have been around three in the morning. Father got up, keeping the bed between him and me, and started to pull his trousers on. "Don't bother about dressing," I said. "Just name some towns in New Jersey." While he hastily pulled on his clothes--I remember he left his socks off and put his shoes on his bare feet--father began to name, in a shaky voice, various New Jersey cities. I can still see him reaching for his coat without taking his eyes off me. "Newark," he said, "Jersey City, Atlantic City, Elizabeth, Paterson, Passaic, Trenton, Jersey City, Trenton, Paterson--" "It has two names," I snapped. "Elizabeth and Paterson," he said. </blockquote> Of course, things turn out fine, as well they should. And why not? The best of Thurber, which <i>The Thurber Carnival</i> arguably is, is sublime; surprising insight and wry observations tossed lightly and served constantly with effortless good humor and an obvious love for all things gently eccentric. <i>--Michael Hudson</i>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>When God Doesn&#39;t Answer Your Prayer</h2><p>More than a decade ago, Jerry Sittser prayed for the protection of his family, yet three of his loved ones---his daughter, his wife, and his mother---died in an automobile accident. What went wrong? &#39;Why wasn&#39;t my prayer answered?&#39; he asks. &#39;It is no longer an abstract question to me. What should we do and how should we respond when our prayers---prayers that seem right and true and good---go unanswered?&#39; In When God Doesn&#39;t Answer Your Prayer, Sittser continues exploring the issues he addressed in A Grace Disguised. He asks, &#39;Why doesn&#39;t God answer our prayers? What, if anything, can we do about it?&#39; Sittser is intensely committed to exploring the Christian faith, especially when it doesn&#39;t seem to &#39;work.&#39; In this thoughtful and beautifully written book, he moves beyond easy answers and religious formulas to explore the goodness and greatness of a God who cannot be controlled but can be trusted. When God Doesn&#39;t Answer Your Prayer takes an honest and probing look at the problem of unanswered prayer. In doing so, it draws us ever deeper into a relationship with the God who is the end of all our prayers, the object of our faith, the one who fulfills our deepest longings.</p><p>Jerry Sittser (PhD, University of Chicago) is a professor of religion at Whitworth College. He holds a master of divinity degree from Fuller Theological Seminary and a doctorate in history from the University of Chicago. He is the author of several books, including When God Doesn&#39;t Answer Your Prayer and The Will of God as a Way of Life. SPANISH BIO: Gerald L. Sittser es profesor de religion y filosofia en Whitworth College en Spokane, Washington. Ostenta un titulo de maestro en divinidades obtenido en el Seminario Teologico Fuller y un doctorado en historia de la Universidad de Chicago. Es escritor de muchos libros incluyendo. Cuando Dios No Contesta tu Oracion. Y La Voluntad de Dios Como una Salida de la Vida.Few people know the desperate agony of unanswered prayer as much as Sittser, whose mother, wife and young daughter died when a drunk driver hit their car. (He and three other children survived.) "Why doesn't God answer our prayers?... It is no longer an abstract question to me," he writes. To find an answer, he turns the question inside out and upside down: When our prayers go unanswered, does it mean we don't have enough faith, or have prayed the wrong way? What would happen if God answered all our prayers? Prayer seems to work sometimes, "which only makes the problem of unanswered prayer more bewildering." Sittser acknowledges that some answered prayers would be bad for us we might use the power of prayer for wealth, success and domination at the expense of others. His own eloquent and powerful musings are interspersed with thoughts from such classic writers as Jean-Pierre de Caussade, Tolstoy and O. Hallesby, and contemporary writers such as Jane Kenyon, Henri Nouwen and Leif Enger. In the end, he writes that unanswered prayer challenges us to explore the deepest places within us and to ask ourselves searching questions. "Perhaps how we respond in the face of such mystery is more important than whether or not we will ever find an answer to the question itself," he muses. Although the study questions at the end of each chapter can be distracting, any Christian who has ever questioned the validity of prayer will find this to be a luminous book, full of vulnerable and venerable wisdom. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Born in Stockholm in 1948, Spiegelman rejected his parents' aspirations for him to become a dentist and he began to study cartooning in high school and drawing professionally at age 16. In 2005, he was named one of Time magazine&#x2019;s 100 Most Influential People. He was made a Chevalier de l&#x2019;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France in 2005 and the American equivalent played himself on an episode of The Simpsons&#x201d; in 2008. He has published Meta Maus, a companion to The Complete Maus, which was awarded the National Jewish Book Award. In 2011, Art Spiegelman won the Grand Prix at the Angoul�me International Comics Festival. His next book, CO-MIX: A Retrospective of Comics, Graphics, and Scraps, will be published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly in September 2013. He lives in New York City, with his wife and collaborator, Fran�oise Mouly, TOON Books' Editorial Director.Comic visionary and living legend Spiegelman has ignored the effects of Early Success Syndrome and plowed right ahead, finding different methods of bringing sequential art to new audiences in interesting ways. Attempting to match the extraordinary achievement of Maus (1986)&nbsp;would be difficult, to say the least, so he and wife Francoise Mouly have developed the Toon imprint for very young readers. Balancing the aesthetic of comics with the familiarity of picture books, and even harkening back to Dr. Seuss, Spiegelman has produced a polished and fun story following a young bunny&#x2019;s struggle with his new jack-in-the-box, which proves to be hyperactive and rather argumentative. With plenty of word repetition and age-appropriate humor to keep pre- and early readers engaged and curious, Spiegelman has taken sequential-art basics and fitted them to his new audience. Like all the Toon books released so far (Benny and Penny in Just Pretend, Silly Lilly and the Four Seasons, and Otto&#x2019;s Orange Day, all 2008), Jack and the Box is beautifully conceived and executed.

Malta had become one of the most strategically important places in the world. From there, the Allies could attack Axis supply lines to North Africa; without it, Rommel would be able to march unchecked into Egypt, Suez and the Middle East. For the Allies this would have been catastrophic. As Churchill said, Malta had to be held &#39;at all costs&#39;.FORTRESS MALTA follows the story through the eyes of those who were there: young men such as twenty-year-old fighter pilot Raoul Daddo-Langlois, anti-aircraft gunner Ken Griffiths, American Art Roscoe and submariner Tubby Crawford - who served on the most successful Allied submarine of the Second World War; cabaret dancer-turned RAF plotter Christina Ratcliffe, and her lover, the brilliant and irrepressible reconnaissance pilot, Adrian Warburton. Their stories and others provide extraordinary first-hand accounts of heroism, resilience, love, and loss, highlighting one of the most remarkable stories of World War II.</p><p>James Holland studied history at Durham University. He writes articles and reviews for Daily Telegraph, Sunday Times, The Times, Sunday Express and New Statesman on twentieth Century social history and the second world war. He has also worked in the publicity departments for major publishing houses most recently responsible for the publicity on Anthony Beever&#39;s number one bestseller &#39;Berlin&#39;.From British journalist Holland comes this superbly engaging history of Malta, the island that was bombed more heavily than any other territory during World War II. Lying in a strategic position between Sicily and Africa, Malta oversaw the shipping routes that supplied the Axis campaign in North Africa, routes that the British were determined to control. Thus, they insisted on holding the island as a base, despite a prolonged aerial bombardment that nearly destroyed the garrison and subjected the island's population to famine. Dismissing the controversy over whether Malta and the Eastern Mediterranean were really worth holding on to during the war, Holland focuses on the people who lived and fought on the island. Drawing on dairies, letters and interviews, he reconstructs the stories of RAF pilot Alex Mackie, who was killed in his Hurricane over Malta, and the legendary photo-recon pilot Adrian Warburton, among many others. The sea and air battles around the island are also vividly depicted, but the real value of this book lies in its rare, intimate description of the Maltese perspective on the siege. Turning the last page, one understands why the island of Malta was collectively awarded the George Cross, the highest British civilian award for heroism. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Caroline&#39;s Secret (A Wells Landing Romance)</h2><p>In Amy Lillard's poignant introduction to Wells Landing, a small Amish community is home to two brave souls hoping to forget their painful pasts and rebuild their faith in the future. . .<br><br>Caroline Hostetler arrived in Oklahoma determined to forge a new life for herself and her daughter, Emma.

In fact, the only thing about this "Deluxe Limited Special Never Before Never Again Extra Stuff 10 Year Anniversary Edition" that's different from the original is the dust jacket--but it's a very special dust jacket, as narrator Jack is quick to point out. Turn it inside out and discover the long-lost story of "The Boy Who Cried Cow Patty" <i>and</i> the numbers that fell off the table of contents. Open the book to be privy to John Scieszka and Lane Smith's irreverent variations on well-known fairy-tale themes, in which the ugly duckling grows up to be an ugly duck, and the princess who kisses the frog wins only a mouthful of amphibian slime. <i>The Stinky Cheese Man</i> deconstructs not only the tradition of the fairy tale but also the entire notion of a book. Our naughty narrator, Jack, makes a mockery of the title page, the table of contents, and even the endpaper by shuffling, scoffing, and generally paying no mind to structure. Characters slide in and out of tales; Cinderella rebuffs Rumpelstiltskin, and the Giant at the top of the beanstalk snacks on the Little Red Hen.

They were invincible: they led the New York City baseball dynasty, which for eight consecutive years held an iron grip on the World Series championship. <br><br>Then the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1953, becoming surprise revolutionaries. Led by visionary owner Lou Perini, the Braves formed a powerful relationship with the Miller Brewing Company and foreshadowed the Dodgers and Giants moving west, sparking continental expansion and the ballpark boom. <br><br>But the rest of the country wasn't sold. Why would a major league team move to a minor league town? In big cities like New York, Milwaukee was thought to be a podunk train station stop-off where the fans were always drunk and wouldn't know a baseball from a beer. They called Milwaukee <i>Bushville</i>.<br><br>The Braves were no bushers! Eddie Mathews was a handsome home run hitter with a rugged edge. Warren Spahn was the craftiest pitcher in the business. Lew Burdette was a sharky spitball artist. Taken together, the Braves reveled in the High Life and made Milwaukee famous, while Wisconsin fans showed the rest of the country how to crack a cold one and throw a tailgate party. And in 1954, a solemn and skinny slugger came from Mobile to Milwaukee. Henry Aaron began his march to history. <br><br>With a cast of screwballs, sluggers and beer swiggers, the Braves proved the guys at the corner bar could do the impossible - topple Casey Stengel's New York baseball dynasty in a World Series for the ages.</p><p>Questions people ask John Klima&nbsp;about <i>Bushville Wins!</i> <br><br>Q: Did I speak to Henry Aaron? <br>A: Yes. I called him Mr. Aaron. What&nbsp;was I supposed to do, call him Hank? We talked about what Milwaukee was like in the 1950s, what the Braves were like. We talked about his relationships with Eddie Mathews and Warren Spahn. We went through some of the big moments and big at-bats. It was a really productive interview and I think it shows in the book. He made his lineup better -- and he made my book better. And I didn't even have to pitch to him. (I would have walked him.) <br><br>Q: Did the Milwaukee Braves really "change" baseball?<br>A: Yes. Ask Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas, Oakland, Arizona, Seattle, Kansas City, Minnesota, San Diego, Miami, Toronto, Tampa. The Milwaukee Braves proved the expansion model we know today worked: new markets, new ballparks, new fans, new TV deals. But when owner Lou Perini moved the Braves from Boston to Milwaukee in 1953, he was laughed at. Mr. Perini was vastly ahead of his time, easily by 25 or 30 years, and for this reason his vision and his team changed the game, and he belongs in the Hall of Fame. I know some of the fans in Milwaukee are still mad about the move to Atlanta, but the Brewers are there because the Braves were there first. <br><br>Q: Did the ballplayers really talk like this, drink like this, fight like this, or are you making this stuff up?<br>A: Nope. I wrote them the way they were, because Milwaukee loved them for who they were. It is an honest book. This is how ballplayers think, talk and act. I've been around them my entire career. My goal was to put the fan not in the stands -- but in the dugout or on the field. <br><br>Q: Why didn't anyone do this story before you?<br>A: Because after the Braves finally got over the hump in 1957, they blew it in 1958. For the Yankees to admit that they won in 1958 would mean they would have to explain what Casey Stengel was thinking when he opened his mouth in 1957. And that just ain't the Yankee way. <br><br>Q: Why do John Klima's baseball books sound so much different than many other baseball authors?<br>A: Because I've been&nbsp;in the game for a long time. I've seen it from the inside out, from top to bottom.&nbsp;If you want baseball literature written the way people who populate the game are, I'm your guy. I came up as a sportswriter, but I don't write like one at all. I don't use standard jargon. I don't write like every word is profound. I don't rely on strained analogies or pop culture references that have nothing to do with the subject. I also possess a far greater base of historical knowledge because I read a great deal of old material. I have many different influences that help my baseball writing, and as a result, I think my&nbsp;facility with language and ability to out-research others really helps the book "play up" as the scouts might say. <br><br>Q: Who else did you talk to for this book?<br>A: In addition to&nbsp;Mr. Aaron, there was Bob Uecker, Del Crandall, Red Schoendienst, Frank Torre, Johnny Logan and the families of Lou Perini and sportswriter Lou Chapman. <br><br>Q: If you were scouting Henry Aaron in 1952, what would your report say?<br>A: I'd hope that I got him right, then put my job on the line to say: "Best hitter I've ever seen. Easy, loose, explosive hands generate plus, plus raw power with bat control. Middle of the order hitter in the National League. Hits off front foot -- keeps hands back -- ferocious bat speed with uppercut. Naturally aggressive hitter. Rangy-bodied outfielder with physical projection and good actions. Not an infielder. Arm for RF, runs enough for CF. Should be above-average defender in best years. The rare complete package."&nbsp;Klima spoke at length with Hank Aaron, who describes why Milwaukee provided the most meaningful home run and describes the impact the Milwaukee years had on his baseball career. He also shares a artfully profane interview with Bob Uecker, then just a high school kid named Bobby dreaming of one day becoming a Brave. Also with new interviews with Frank Torre, Red Schoendienst, Del Crandall, unpublished notes from Casey Stengel and Jackie Robinson, and a never-before published photo of Mickey Mantle really, really drunk.</p><h2>Perspective Depth &amp; Distance (Watercolour Painting Tips &amp; Techniques)</h2><p>Clear, practical and easy-to-follow, this book draws the reader into understanding the principles of perspective using simple techniques, tips and step-by-step demonstrations.</p><p>Geoff Kersey is an experienced watercolourist and is much in demand as a teacher and demonstrator.

Arrington&#39;s much older husband, the actor Vance Calder, has just died, leaving her a fortune in Centurion Studios stock. Arrington has plans for the money and asks Stone to represent her in the sale of the company. But when he arrives at her home in Bel-Air to finalize the deal, things take a nasty turn. It seems many of Hollywood&#39;s rich and beautiful have Arrington and Centurion in their sights, and Stone finds himself dragged into a surprisingly deadly web of intrigue.</p><p><b>Stuart Woods</b> is the author of more than forty novels. A native of Georgia, he began his writing career in the advertising industry. <i>Chiefs,</i> his debut in 1981, won the Edgar Award. An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in Florida, Maine, and New York.<b>1</b><p>Elaine&#x2019;s, late.<br>Stone Barrington sat with his client, Mike Freeman, of Strategic Services, and his former partner from his NYPD days, Dino Bacchetti, over the ruins of dinner and a bottle of excellent Cabernet.<br>&#x201c;That was good,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;I never knew how good the food was here, until you started bringing me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Comfort food,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Elaine sat herself down in the spare chair. &#x201c;Comfort food?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Is that some kind of crack?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s high praise,&#x201d; Stone said quickly, not wanting to get her started. Elaine&#x2019;s did not enjoy a high reputation with the food critics of the local media, because they didn&#x2019;t come often enough to get the good tables, but the regulars knew how good the food was, and that was all she really cared about.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take high praise,&#x201d; Elaine said.<br>Stone&#x2019;s cell phone hummed on his belt, and he dug it out of its holster. &#x201c;Stone Barrington.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stone, it&#x2019;s Arrington,&#x201d; she said. Stone and Arrington had once been a very big item, to the extent of his having fathered a son by her.<br>&#x201c;Well, hello there,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d never hear from you again.&#x201d; They had spent one night together in his Maine house, on Islesboro, at Dark Harbor, and then she had taken her leave, saying it was over.<br>&#x201c;I want to hire you,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m for hire. How&#x2019;s Peter?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He misses his father,&#x201d; she said.<br>Stone wondered which father she meant, himself or her late husband, movie megastar Vance Calder, whose son the world believed Peter to be. Stone didn&#x2019;t know what to say.<br>&#x201c;I mean Vance,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He hardly knows you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Why do you want to hire me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to say this fast, because I&#x2019;m sleepy, and I want to go to bed. I know you&#x2019;re at Elaine&#x2019;s at this hour, but I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So, say it fast.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You remember Centurion Studios? A large Hollywood film factory.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I believe so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You remember that Vance owned a third of the shares when he died?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it was that much.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d been buying the stock for many years, every time somebody died and some shares became available.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a stockholders&#x2019; meeting coming up, and there will be a vote on whether to sell the studio. It has always been closely held, and Vance wanted to keep it that way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s buying?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, some corporation or other. They&#x2019;ll sell the property to developers, and the studio will just be a letterhead.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And what do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vote my shares against the sale, and do what you can to get the other stockholders to vote against it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How many are there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A couple of dozen, maybe. I&#x2019;ll send you a list, along with my signed proxy, to the Bel-Air house. You can have the guesthouse, as usual. Manolo and Carmen will take good care of you.&#x201d;<br>Manolo and Carmen were the Filipino houseman and his wife who ran the place. Stone knew he would be taken care of very well indeed. &#x201c;All right, I guess I can manage that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can you get there tomorrow?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Or the day after,&#x201d; Stone said. He wanted to fly himself in his new airplane.<br>&#x201c;I guess that will be all right,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;You remember Rick Barron?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I met him and his wife at Vance&#x2019;s burial.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Call him as soon as you get there, and take him and his wife, Glenna, to dinner. Rick is in his nineties now, but he&#x2019;s sharp as a straight razor, and he&#x2019;s leading the fight to keep the studio closely held.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be glad to do that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In fact, invite them to the house, and let Manolo and Carmen do the dinner. They know all the Barrons&#x2019; favorite dishes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Call me when you get there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Say hello to Elaine and Dino.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Goodbye.&#x201d; She hung up.<br>Stone put away his phone. &#x201c;Arrington says hello to both of you,&#x201d; he said to them.<br>&#x201c;How is she?&#x201d; Elaine asked.<br>&#x201c;Sleepy,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;Dino, you want to spend a few days in L.A.?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On whose nickel?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;Transportation is free, and we&#x2019;ll be staying in Arrington&#x2019;s guesthouse.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Mike spoke up. &#x201c;Can you just walk away from the NYPD that way?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I get time off, just like everybody,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;but I get to approve when, and I approve this one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Mike said.<br>&#x201c;Mike,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;Dino has the NYPD by the ear, didn&#x2019;t you know? He&#x2019;s a law unto himself over there. The new commissioner, who doesn&#x2019;t know him very well, loves him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d love me more, if he knew me better,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Elaine pinched Dino&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;To know him is to love him,&#x201d; she said, planting a big kiss on his forehead. She got up and made her move to the next table of regulars.<br>Dino rubbed his cheek. &#x201c;I hope she didn&#x2019;t make a bruise.&#x201d; &#x201c;With that five o&#x2019;clock shadow, who could tell?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;You guys have the life,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll bet you&#x2019;re going to fly the Mustang out there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You betcha,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br>&#x201c;Hey, wait a minute,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t volunteer for suicide.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time you had your first flight in the Citation Mustang,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right, Dino,&#x201d; Mike echoed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love it.&#x201d;<br>Dino looked doubtful. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know if God intended Stone to be put in charge of a jet airplane.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You liked my old airplane well enough,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, but it had a propeller up front that made it go, and I took comfort in that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Mustang has two engines, Dino,&#x201d; Mike said, &#x201c;and they&#x2019;re fan jets. Twice the safety.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No propellers, though.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Propellers would just slow it down,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Mike, you think I should do this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve flown with him, Dino; he&#x2019;ll get you there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, okay, if you say so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You get a choice of seats,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Up front with me, or you can lounge in the back and sleep all the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How could I sleep with you at the controls?&#x201d; Dino asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take my chances up front, where I can do something, if I have to.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll teach you to fly the airplane, Dino,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s a good idea. That way when you turn blue and clutch your chest, I can save myself.&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>Animal Talk: Interspecies Telepathic Communications</h2><p>Explains how to develop mind-to-mind communication with animals while discussing obedience, behavior issues, nutrition, control, freedom, and the relationship between children and animals.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what you cat or dog or horse is thinking?

He has written numerous biographies (including the internationally bestselling&nbsp;<i>I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovi&#x107;,</i>&nbsp;for which he was the ghostwriter) and four novels, including&nbsp;<i>Fall of Man in Wilmslow,&nbsp;</i>and the #1 bestselling&nbsp;<i>The Girl in the Spider's Web.</i>Lisbeth Salander was on her way back to her cell from the gym and the showers when she was stopped in the corridor by the warden. Alvar Olsen was blathering on about something, gesticulating wildly and waving a set of papers. But Salander could not hear a word he said. It was 7:30 p.m.<br><br>That was the most dangerous time at Flodberga Prison. Seven-thirty p.m. was when the daily freight train thundered past; the walls shook and keys rattled and the place smelled of sweat and perfume. All the worst abuses took place then, masked by the racket from the railway and in the general confusion just before the cell doors were shut. Salander always let her gaze wander back and forth over the unit at this time of day and it was probably no coincidence that she caught sight of Faria Kazi.<br><br>Faria was young and beautiful, from Bangladesh, and she was sitting in her cell. From where Salander and Olsen stood, all Salander could see was her face. Someone was slapping Faria. Her head kept jerking from side to side, though the blows were not that hard&#x2014;there was something almost routine about them. It was clear from Faria&#x2019;s humiliated expression that the abuse had been going on for a long time and had broken her will to resist.<br><br>No hands were raised to try to stop the slapping, and in Faria&#x2019;s eyes there was no indication of surprise, only a mute, dull fear. This terror was part of her life. Salander could see that just by studying her face, and it matched what she had observed during her weeks at the prison.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you look at that,&#x201d; she said, pointing into Faria&#x2019;s cell. But by the time Olsen had turned to look, it was over. Salander&nbsp; disappeared&nbsp; into&nbsp; her&nbsp; own&nbsp; cell&nbsp; and&nbsp; closed&nbsp; the door. She could hear voices and muffled laughter in the corridor and outside the freight train clanging by, shaking the walls. She stood in front of the shiny washbasin and narrow bed, the bookshelf and desk strewn with pages of her quantum mechanical calculations. Did she feel like doing more work on loop quantum gravity theory? She realized she was holding something and looked down at her hand.<br><br>It was the same sheaf of papers that Olsen had been waving around, and that did, after all, make her a little curious. But it was some sort of rubbish with coffee cup rings all over the cover page: an intelligence test. Ridiculous. She hated to be prodded and measured.<br><br>She dropped the papers which spread like a fan on the concrete floor. For a brief moment they vanished from her mind as her thoughts went back to Faria Kazi. Salander had not seen who was hitting her. But she knew perfectly well who it was. Although at first prison life had not interested Salander, reluctantly she had been drawn in, decoding the visible and invisible signals one by one. By now she understood who called the shots.<br><br>This was called the B Unit, the secure section. It was considered the safest place in the institution, and to a visitor that might have been how it seemed. There were more guards, more controls and more rehabilitation programmes here than anywhere else in the prison. But anyone who took a closer look would realize there was something rotten about the place. The guards put on an act, exuding authority, and they even pretended to care. But in fact they were cowards who had lost control, and they had ceded power to their chief antagonists, gang leader Benito Andersson and her mob.<br><br>During the day Benito kept a low profile and behaved like a model prisoner, but after the evening meal, when the inmates could exercise or receive visits, she took over. At this time of day her reign of terror was uncontested, just before the doors were locked for the night. As the prisoners roamed between cells, making threats and promises in whispered tones, Benito&#x2019;s gang kept to one side, their victims to the other.<br><br>The fact that Salander was in prison at all was a major scandal. But circumstances had hardly been on her side, nor had she put up a very convincing fight. The interlude seemed absurd to her, but she also thought she might just as well be in jail as anywhere else.<br><br>She had been sentenced to&nbsp; two&nbsp; months&nbsp; for&nbsp; unlawful use of property and reckless endangerment in the dramatic events following the murder of Professor Frans Balder. Salander had taken it upon herself to hide his eight-year-old autistic son and refused to cooperate with the police because she believed&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;that the police investigation had been betrayed. No-one disputed that she went to heroic lengths to save the child&#x2019;s life. Even so, Chief Prosecutor Richard Ekstr�m led the case with great conviction, and the court ultimately found against her, although one of the lay judges dissented. Salander&#x2019;s lawyer, Annika Giannini, had done an outstanding job. But she got virtually no help from her client, so that in the end Salander did not stand a chance. She maintained a sullen silence throughout the trial and refused to appeal the verdict. She simply wanted to get the business over with.<br>&nbsp;<br>At first she was sent to Bj�rng�rda G�rd open prison, where she had a lot of freedom. Then new information surfaced, suggesting there were people who wanted to harm her. This was not entirely unexpected, given the enemies she had made, so she was transferred to the secure wing at Flodberga.<br><br>Salander had no problem sharing space with Sweden&#x2019;s most notorious female criminals. She was constantly surrounded by guards, and no assaults or violence had been reported in the unit for many years. Records also showed that an impressive number of inmates had been rehabilitated. But those statistics all came from the time before the arrival of Benito Andersson.<br><br>From the day Salander arrived at the prison, she faced a variety of provocations. She was a high-profile prisoner known from media coverage, not to mention the rumours that spread through the underworld. Only a few days earlier, Benito had put a note in her hand which read: friend or enemy? Salander had thrown it away after a minute&#x2014;it took about fifty-eight seconds before she could be bothered to read it.<br>&nbsp;<br>She had no interest in power struggles or alliances. She concentrated on observing and learning, and by now she felt she had learned more than enough. She stared blankly at her bookshelf, stocked with the essays on quantum field theory she had ordered before she landed inside. In the cupboard on the left were two changes of prison clothes, all stamped with the initials of the prison service, plus some underwear and two pairs of sneakers. There was nothing on the walls, not a single reminder of life on the outside. She cared no more for the surroundings in her cell than those in her home on Fiskargatan.<br><br>Cell doors were being shut along the corridor and normally that meant some freedom for Salander. When the noise died down, she could lose herself in mathematics&#x2014;in attempts to combine quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity&#x2014;and forget the world around her. But tonight was different. She was irritated, and not just because of the abuse of Faria Kazi or the rampant corruption in the unit.<br><br>She could not stop thinking about the visit six days earlier from Holger Palmgren, her old guardian from the time when the authorities had decided she was incapable of taking care of herself. The visit had been a major production. Palmgren was entirely dependent on home aides and assistants and hardly ever left his apartment in Liljeholmen. But he had been adamant. The social service&#x2019;s subsidized transport service brought him in his wheelchair, as he wheezed into an oxygen mask. Salander was glad to see him.<br><br>She and Palmgren had spoken of old times and he had become sentimental and emotional. There was just one thing that troubled Salander. Palmgren told her that a woman by the name of Maj-Britt Torell had been to see him. She used to be a secretary at St. Stefan&#x2019;s psychiatric clinic for children, where Salander had been a patient. The woman had read about Salander in the newspapers and brought Palmgren some documents which she believed he might find interesting. According to Palmgren it was more of the same old horror stories about how Salander had been strapped to her bed in the clinic and subjected to the worst kind of psychological abuse. &#x201c;Nothing you need to see,&#x201d; he said. Still, something must have stood out, because when Palmgren asked about her dragon tattoo and the woman with the birthmark, he said:<br><br>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t she from the Registry?&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Registry for the Study of Genetics and Social Environment in Uppsala? I thought I read that somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The name must have been in those new documents,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;You think so? Perhaps I&#x2019;m just muddling it all up.&#x201d; Perhaps he was. Palmgren had grown old. Yet the information stuck in Salander&#x2019;s mind. It had gnawed at her while she trained on the speedball in the gym in the afternoons and worked in the ceramics workshop in the mornings. It gnawed away at her now as she stood in her cell looking down at the floor.<br><br>Somehow the I.Q. test which lay spread across the concrete no longer seemed irrelevant, but rather a continuation of her conversation with Palmgren. For a moment Salander could not grasp why. Then she remembered that the woman with the birthmark had given her all kinds of tests in those days. They always ended in arguments and eventually with Salander, at the age of just six, escaping into the night.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet what was most striking about these memories was not the tests or her running away, but the growing suspicion that there was something fundamental about her childhood she did not understand. She knew she had to find out more.<br><br>True, she would soon be outside again and free to do as she wanted. But she also knew she had leverage with Warden Olsen. This was not the first time he had chosen to turn a blind eye to abuses, and the unit he headed, still a source of pride in the prison service, was in a state of moral decay. Salander guessed she could get Olsen to give her access to something no-one else in the prison was allowed&#x2014;an Internet&nbsp; connection.<br><br>She listened for sounds in the corridor. Muttered curses could be heard, along with doors being slammed, keys rattling and footsteps tapping off into the distance. Then silence fell. The only noise came from the ventilation system. It was broken&#x2014;the air was stifling, unbearable&#x2014;but still humming away. Salander looked at the papers on the floor and thought about Benito, Faria Kazi and Alvar Olsen&#x2014;and the woman with the fiery birthmark on her throat.<br><br>She bent to pick up the test, sat down at the desk and scribbled out some answers. Then she pressed the intercom button by the steel door. Olsen picked up after a long interval, sounding nervous. She said she needed to talk to him right away.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; she said.</p><h2>The Drop (A Harry Bosch Novel, 15)</h2><p>Harry Bosch has been given three years before he must retire from the LAPD, and he wants cases more fiercely than ever.

Curtis is married and lives in Brea, California.<i>Chapter 1: The Last Mile</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In the years prior to 1924, Texas counties with inmates convicted of capital crimes conducted their own executions, generally by hanging. Then the legislature consolidated all such business at the State Penitentiary in Huntsville, establishing a death row at the birthplace of Sam Houston. Its centerpiece, at the end of a brief corridor adjacent to nine holding cells, was a handsome new electric chair, built of solid oak by prison craftsmen. They did their work well; over the next forty years, &#x201c;Old Sparky&#x201d; would become the final unpadded resting stop for 361 men and women on their way to court-mandated eternity. One such prisoner, a condemned killer called Robert Blake, was dispatched on April 19, 1929&#x2014;but not before having set down on paper a taste of life in the Texas death house called &#x201c;The Law Takes Its Toll.&#x201d;<br><br>When the <i>American Mercury</i> posthumously published the sketch in July of that year, it attracted a lot of attention, including that of a twenty-two-year-old actor and playwright named Ely John Wexley. Blake&#x2019;s account, in the form of a one-act play, covered the eighteen hours leading up to the execution of Number Six, one of a handful of condemned men&#x2014;five white, one Mexican&#x2014;at Huntsville. Number Seven breaks into verse more often than not, Number Nine has gone mad, howling &#x201c;Jo-------nes!&#x201d; at all hours. The talk among the others centers on clemency, then the banter turns grim as the details of the condemned man&#x2019;s ritual play themselves out&#x2014;the last meal, the slitting of the trouser legs, the shaving of the head, and the ceremonial reading of the death warrant.<br><br> &#x201c;Wonder how it will feel,&#x201d; Six muses. &#x201c;I hope it won&#x2019;t take long. Wonder if a fellow knows anything after the first shot hits him . . . You know, it&#x2019;s funny. I was worse at my trial than I am here. I almost broke down there at the trial. I lost 15 pounds when my trial was going on.&#x201d; The guard, having some difficulty opening the door to the death chamber, yanks at the lock and rattles it. Number Seven tells Six to take the keys and open the door himself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d stay here until next Christmas before I&#x2019;d open that door for &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Six declares. &#x201c;Well, the door is open. I&#x2019;ll say goodbye to everybody again.&#x201d;<br><br>These lines, Blake notes, were written while Six was being strapped into the chair. &#x201c;I hope I am the last one that ever sits in this chair,&#x201d; Six calls out. &#x201c;Tell my mother that my last words were of her.&#x201d; The lights go dim as they hear the whine of a motor. The others cry out, and then the lights go dim again and yet again. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re giving him the juice again!&#x201d; shouts Number Five. &#x201c;Wonder<br> what they&#x2019;re trying to do, <i>cook</i> him?&#x201d;<br><br>Wexley saw the basis of a full-length play in &#x201c;The Law Takes Its Toll,&#x201d; struggled with the problem of expanding it to three acts until the events of October 3, 1929. The attempted escape of two prisoners at the Colorado State Penitentiary in Ca�on City went awry when a guard was killed while grappling over a set of keys. Knowing they&#x2019;d hang for his death and, consequently, had nothing to lose, the convicts began taking hostages. In the bloody standoff that followed, eight guards and five inmates were killed and another ten were wounded. Wexley plumbed the New York dailies for details of the riot, and his play took shape within a couple of weeks.<br><br>The first act was Blake&#x2019;s sketch almost verbatim, Wexley&#x2019;s chief liberty being to change Blake&#x2019;s Mexican prisoner to a black man. The second and third acts portrayed an opportunistic escape attempt patterned on the events at Ca�on City. In the end, the matter of a title was more vexing than the structure; Wexley had inserted bits of Tennyson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Charge of the Light Brigade&#x201d; amid the machine gun bursts of his play&#x2019;s final moments (&#x201c;Oh, the wild charge they made! All the world wondered!&#x201d;) and so he decided to call it <i>All the World Wondered</i>. Inexplicably, his agent sent the play to producer Herman E. Shumlin, a onetime reporter and press agent whose track record was 0&#x2013;4, his last play having tanked just two days prior to the onset of Black Tuesday. Shumlin, who was used to seeing only &#x201c;the bottom of the barrel,&#x201d; was astonished at the raw power of Wexley&#x2019;s play and managed to scare up the money to produce it at a time when &#x201c;all the backers anybody could think of were jumping out of high windows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was one o&#x2019;clock when I finished reading it,&#x201d; Shumlin recalled, &#x201c;and I went all the way out to Brooklyn and woke up Sam Golden, the printer, and read it to him.* He gave me a check for $500 to buy an option on the play, I think maybe because he wanted to go back to bed. After that, my troubles began, raising the money to put the show on. I borrowed from a bank. I squeezed my relatives dry.&#x201d; The title was the first thing to go, but it would be nearly a month before the play had the title under which it would see its Broadway debut: <i>The Last Mile</i>. <br><br>To direct, Shumlin selected Chester Erskine, who had earlier had a hand in staging <i>The Criminal Code</i>, a similarly themed prison drama that was one of the season&#x2019;s few genuine hits. Briefly an actor but too tall and pale for anything but character work, Erskine knew the success of Wexley&#x2019;s play would depend on its casting and the ability of its actors to inhabit their characters to the point of morbidity. Skeptical of Spencer Tracy from the outset, Erskine regarded their meeting as a courtesy at first, not the urgent mating dance that comes with the ideal match of actor and role. &#x201c;I had seen a few of his performances,&#x201d; Shumlin said, &#x201c;and was not overly impressed by him as a candidate for the lead in <i>The Last Mile</i>. I was just about to dismiss him when something about our too-brief casting interview stayed with me. Since it was getting on to dinnertime, I invited him to join me at a theatrical haunt. There, in a less strained atmosphere, I was suddenly made aware as we were talking that, beneath the surface, here was a man of passion, violence, sensitivity, and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part.&#x201d;<br><br> Wexley&#x2019;s play was intense, grim, uncompromising; hard to take over the course of three acts. And there were no women in the cast, an anomaly on Broadway, where the ticket-buying decisions were often made by wives and girlfriends and where the matinee trade was crucial to the success of a show. Louise, as was her habit, read the script and told Spence she thought it &#x201c;pretty bad.&#x201d; There was little that jumped off the page, other than the unusually coarse language tossed between the prisoners. &#x201c;It was so<i> violent</i>, she said, grimacing. &#x201c;That was the kind of part I never liked him in.&#x201d; <br><br>Tracy&#x2019;s contract for <i>All the World Wondered</i>, signed on January 14, 1930, called for his now standard price of $400 a week, payable Saturdays, and weekly bonuses of $50 and $100 if the gross hit $8,000 and $10,000, respectively. Rehearsals began the following day, Tracy meeting his fellow prisoners for the first time: James Bell, who would play the gutsy Richard Walters, Cell 7, whose execution is imminent as the curtain rises; Howard Phillips, whose hot-tempered Fred Mayor, Cell 3, would be next in rotation; Hale Norcross, who, as &#x201c;Red&#x201d; Kirby, Cell 9, would be the graybeard, the senior member of the group; Ernest Whitman, the muscular black man engaged to play the superstitious Vincent Jackson, Cell 13; George Leach, chosen by Erskine to play Eddie Werner, Cell 11, Wexley&#x2019;s crazy man, a poet of sorts; and Joseph Spurin-Calleia, the Maltese actor and singer who would by playing the dapper Tom D&#x2019;Amoro, Cell No. 1. All took their places alongside the men who would be their captors: Don Costello, Herbert Heywood, Orville Harris, Ralph Theadore, Richard Abbott, Henry O&#x2019;Neill, Clarence Chase, Allen Jenkins, Albert West.<br><br>&#x201c;The sixteen were seated in a straight line across the stage,&#x201d; Herman Shumlin recalled, &#x201c;and when they read their parts for the first time, it was clear they meant business . . . Maybe (in part, at least) the absence of women in the cast had something to do with it too. With no good-looking actress to make them feel self-conscious, they seemed to forget they were actors of long experience, with all kinds of past performances and position to live up to. Instead, they gave themselves up completely to the emotional fury of the play and into the guiding hands of the director.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tracy was perfect. Tracy made the show. But then Tracy got worried and he said he wouldn&#x2019;t do it. He had to shoot a priest in the play and he said he&#x2019;d rather not.&#x201d; Henry O&#x2019;Neill, the actor playing Father O&#x2019;Connors and a fellow Catholic, could see that Tracy&#x2019;s torment was deep and genuine and not simply a dodge, and he took him downtown to see a priest. As Shumlin remembered it, &#x201c;The father told Tracy he need have no scruples,&#x201d; but then Wexley fixed the problem by writing the priest&#x2019;s death out of the script altogether, finding the mere threat of his shooting more effective in sustaining the tension than the act itself.<br><br>Erskine quickly got the show on its feet, marking out the individual cells&#x2014;each just two and a half steps wide&#x2014;on the floor with a piece of chalk. Tracy spent a lot of time miming the window in the back of his cell, looking out to such an exaggerated degree that Erskine, three years his junior, made a memorable comment: &#x201c;Spence, I didn&#x2019;t tell you to break the window, I told you to look through it.&#x201d; His point, which Tracy took to heart, was that a good actor didn&#x2019;t look out the window&#x2014;he let the <i>audience </i>look out the window.<br><br>&#x201c;He was,&#x201d; said Erskine, &#x201c;cooperative and disciplined, and set an attitude for the other performers who followed his lead. He was the kind of actor whom a director leans on for just such behavior.&#x201d; They spent such long hours at it that Tracy took a room at the Lambs Club, three blocks from the theater, to avoid traveling all the way home to Ninety-eighth Street. Tensions ran high, rehearsal being a thoroughly emotional process, and there were more than the usual flashes of temper.<br><br>&#x201c;I cannot remember,&#x201d; wrote Tracy, &#x201c;when I have spent so much time with other members of the cast outside of the theater, discussing the story of the play back and forth. And I don&#x2019;t think any of us can ever forget the first dress rehearsal inside the completed prison set. It had been all very well to pretend to be clutching at bars on bare and dingy stages&#x2014;but now, confined within a four-by-nine cell, chafing at real cold steel&#x2014;well, it was a sensation! The end of the first act found us rushing out into the wings, desperate for cigarettes. Nobody had any intention of staying in the cell longer than necessary.&#x201d;<br><br>Never before had Tracy immersed himself so deeply in a part, and never had he felt so completely drained by one. &#x201c;As Killer Mears he had to expose a less-winning phase of his personality,&#x201d; Erskine said, &#x201c;one which might unlock secrets of his inner self and which he would have preferred to remain hidden. It is a choice many actors have to make but which only the artists can survive.&#x201d;<br> Tempting fate, Shumlin set the New York opening of the play, still titled All the World Wondered, for February 13, pointing out that the numerals in &#x201c;1930&#x201d; added up to thirteen. Tryouts took place at Parsons&#x2019; Theatre in Hartford beginning on the sixth, and the cast, to a man, was dubious. &#x201c;They all felt that the play was a good one, an unusual one,&#x201d; Shumlin said, &#x201c;but they were almost all a little doubtful of its chances for success. This was hardly astonishing since it departed to such a great extent from the traditional rules of what a successful play should be.&#x201d;<br><br>That first performance was a ragged affair, the set being insubstantial compared to what they would have in New York, but Tracy as Mears was letter perfect. &#x201c;Tracy fought the role through rehearsal&#x2014;not the doing of it, but the surrendering to it,&#x201d; Erskine said. &#x201c;When, however, he finally did surrender to it, it was total, absolute, and frightening. He did not simulate anger and violence, he was anger and violence. In one night&#x2014;at the out-of town opening&#x2014;he changed from a presentable juvenile and a hopeful leading man to an artist, a true artist. He had crossed the threshold into that area where he could submerge himself in a role to the point of eliminating himself completely, to the point where he could no longer tell which was which himself.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</h2><p>Here&#39;s a reprint of the long out of print classic work by Captain Francis Grose.

Hart&#x2019;s memoir, <i>Act One</i>, which told of a youth lived in poverty and his early success on Broadway, became the most successful and most loved book ever published about the lure of the theater. But it ended at the beginning&#x2014;when Hart was only twenty-five&#x2014;and at times embroidered or skirted the facts. Now, at last, we have the full and far richer story. <br><br>Hart exemplified wit, urbanity, and grace. He knew everybody, from the Algonquin Round Table crowd <br>to the Gershwins, Irving Berlin, No�l Coward, Cole Porter, and the Hollywood moguls. His passion for the theater gave wings to his long playwriting collaboration with George S. Kaufman; together they gave us such classic comedies as <i>You Can&#x2019;t Take It With You</i> and <i>The Man Who Came to Dinner</i>. On his own Hart wrote the stunning <i>Lady in the Dark</i> and <i>Light Up the Sky</i>. His screenplays include <i>Gentleman&#x2019;s Agreement</i>, <i>Hans Christian Andersen</i>, and the Judy Garland version of <i>A Star Is Born</i>. His career as a director was crowned by the creation of <i>My Fair Lady</i> and <i>Camelot</i>, his last two shows. They were still on Broadway when he died in 1961 at the age of fifty-seven.<br><br>But Hart&#x2019;s life was not always golden, in spite of a Pulitzer Prize, Tony Awards, and Oscar nominations. His successes were shadowed by the unpredictable and often debilitating mood swings of manic depression. And he struggled with issues of sexual identity&#x2014;documented here for the first time&#x2014;finally marrying and fathering children in his forties.<br><br><b>Dazzler</b> is the story of the seen and unseen struggles that beset Hart in a life crowded with friends, glamour, and achievements, a life that seemed to be one triumph and delight after another. But it was actually a life tormented in ways we didn&#x2019;t know, and thus, heroic. It isn&#x2019;t just that Hart rose from humble beginnings to fame and fortune. It&#x2019;s that he rose above his private demons to achieve a kind of happiness that survives him still. He used to say, even in the face of failure, &#x201c;Well, we aspired.&#x201d; Aspiration was a key to his life, and the key to this superb biography.</p><p>"Legendary playwright and director Moss Hart's memoir <i>Act One</i> is still<br>required reading for anyone who dreams of a career on the stage, although<br>it only tells about half the tales of Hart's extraordinary life in and out<br>of the theatre. Fortunately, author Steven Bach has come along to fill in<br>the gaps with his new and long-awaited biography of the great man himself,<br><b>Dazzler: The Life and Times of Moss Hart</b> (Alfred A. Knopf). Bach<br>brilliantly illuminates the complicated genius responsible for co-writing<br>some of the American theatre's greatest comedies, including <i>The Man Who<br>Came to Dinner</i> and <i>You Can't Take It With You</i>, and directing two of the<br>world's most beloved musicals, <i>My Fair Lady</i> and <i>Camelot</i>. Bursting with<br>history and anecdote, <b>Dazzler</b> is a must-read for anyone who cares about the<br>mysterious process of artistic collaboration." --<i>Encore</i><br><br>&#x201c;Steven Bach has evoked a glittering picture of backstage Broadway, in the years that Broadway was the center of theatrical glamour. More importantly, he has understood and brilliantly written the life of the complicated genius, Moss Hart, whose dazzling talent was at the center of the vortex.&#x201d;--Dominick Dunne<br><br> &#x201c;An exhilarating record of a man who made and saved shows and always raised spirits. It is also the touching portrait of the Moss Hart who could not save or reassure himself. It&#x2019;s Dazzler in the Dark.&#x201d;--David Thomson<br><br>&#x201c;A fabulously entertaining life story that is also a searching meditation on show business, celebrity, sex and ego.&#x201d;--Patrick McGilligan<br><br>&#x201c;Ironic, knowing, tartly sympathetic and written with rare wit, pace and grace. It is a superb evocation of that lost (and never-to-return) era when Broadway, ruled by a handful of writers, stars and producers was, for good and ill, the prime source of energy and ideas, talent and glamour for all of American show business. Bach doesn&#x2019;t nostalgize that little world, but he understands it fully, and infects us with Moss Hart joy in conquering it.&#x201d;--Richard Schickel<br><br>&#x201c;A wonderful book about a man who dazzled in a heady time that is long gone. Bach is compulsively readable, and what he has written about both Moss Hart and his time is well worth remembering.&#x201d;--Walter Bernstein<br><br>"Steven Bach is no mean Dazzler himself. His biography of Moss Hart is not only a vivid portrait of a witty but tortured man. It's a wonderfully entertaining guided tour of Broadway's most entertaining age, and the personalities who helped create it."--Gavin Lambert<br><br>"A bountifully entertaining biography<br>...a bonanza for the perpetually famished acolytes of show-biz lore and dish."<br>&#x2013;Jan Stuart, Newsday<br><br>"A Who's Who of the theatre's golden age."<br>&#x2013;Janet Maslin, New York Times<br>Steven Bach was a theatrical and film producer before heading worldwide production at United Artists, where he was involved in such films as <i>Raging Bull</i>, <i>Manhattan</i>, <i>The French Lieutenant&#x2019;s Woman</i>, <i>La Cage aux Folles</i>, and <i>Heaven&#x2019;s Gate</i>, about which he wrote the brilliant best-seller Final Cut.

He lives in Albuquerque, NM, with his wife, writer Laura Mixon.</p>Chapter One<br><br>"Davy was gone."<br><br>The first time was like this.<br><br>"You are the most stubborn man I've ever met."<br><br>The latest incarnation of this argument started in a little pastry shop on Sullivan Street, New York City.<br><br>His first response was light. "You probably shouldn't have married me, then."<br><br>She glared.<br><br>"I can't help it. It's how I feel. At least I know how I feel. That's better than I used to be."<br><br>She watched him push crumbs across the tabletop, herding them into a neat little pile. The busboy was leaning against the lime-colored wall, watching them. They were the last customers in the place and it was almost eleven p.m. on the east coast.<br><br>"Let's get out of here," he said.<br><br>They threaded out between the tiny tables and into the chill air of the street. It was the first week of March. Out of sight, in a deep sheltered doorway smelling faintly of urine, he put his arms around her and jumped them, and the argument, a time zone to the west, to the small two-bedroom condo they owned near her clinic, in Stillwater, Oklahoma.<br><br>Her ears popped and she swallowed reflexively, so used to it that she hardly noticed. She was intensely frustrated. How can you love someone and want to kick them in the butt at the same time? "But what about the way I feel? I'm thirty-one. I'd like to have kids while I'm still young enough to keep up with them!"<br><br>The corners of his mouth turned down. "Look at how my dad---I don't exactly have the right modeling to be a parent."<br><br>You'll never know until you try.<br><br>"And there's the Aerie. It's not exactly kid-safe."<br><br>"We can live here. We can live elsewhere if necessary. It's not as if we don't have the resources."<br><br>"And when the kids start kindergarten? 'Did you take the bus today, little Millie?' 'No, my Daddy teleported me.'"<br><br>She glared at him but she couldn't really find an argument against this one. Was she to ask him to stop jumping? Jump, but lie about it to their child? Let the child know but have them lie? She knew that one all too well. She'd been lying about Davy for ten years.<br><br>He looked at his watch. "I have a meeting with Brian in D.C. in ten minutes. He wants to sell me on another errand."<br><br>Oh, that's convenient! Then she recalled his mentioning it the day before and felt guilty for the thought.<br><br>"You want to wait here?" he asked.<br><br>"How long do you think you'll be?"<br><br>He shrugged. "Not too long, I should think."<br><br>She was still annoyed. "I've got clients at seven-thirty. I need my sleep. You better jump me to bed, first." Though I'd rather you jumped me in bed.<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>He paced while she changed into her nightgown and brushed her teeth. He looked at books, opened them, shut them. When she was ready, he jumped her to the cliff dwelling---their hidden aerie in the rugged desert of far west Texas. It was cool here, but not as cold as New York City.<br><br>He turned on the bedside light and she heard the faint sound of the electrical generator kicking in, from its own enclosure at the far end of the ledge. The furniture, a rough knotty-pine queen-sized bed, contrasted sharply with the more contemporary bedstead back in the condo. The walls, ceiling, and floor were all rough stone, the face of this cliff, and only the rough-mortared outer wall, made of like-colored stone, was man-made. Most of the walls, natural and otherwise, were hidden by rows of knotty pine bookshelves.<br><br>She sat on the edge of the bed and sighed. "We talked about it when we got married, you know."<br><br>He winced. "You said we could take some time, first."<br><br>"It's been ten years!"<br><br>He looked at his watch again. "Look, I've got to go, or I'll be late. We can---"<br><br>She turned her back. "Oh, just go!"<br><br>"Millie...."<br><br>She shook her head. "Go, dammit!" Then she thought better of it and turned back to him, but he'd taken her at her word.<br><br>Davy was gone.<br><br>Of course she couldn't sleep.<br><br>When did I become an appendage? There was a price to be paid, being married to the world's only teleport. It was like being a Saudi wife, unable to travel anywhere unless accompanied by a male relative.<br><br>An appendage.<br><br>She'd accepted this, she realized, quite a long time ago, trading her own independence for the benefits, but she was beginning to feel that something was atrophying. If not my legs, then my spiritual wings.<br><br>And even Saudi wives can have children.<br><br>She alternated between blaming him and blaming herself with brief stints of blaming Mr. Brian Cox of the National Security Agency. The real blame, she knew, if it was going to rest on anyone, belonged to Davy's father, who was an abusive alcoholic when Davy was growing up, but even he'd changed, going through treatment and now a decade of grumpy and uncomfortable sobriety.<br><br>Deciding on blame wasn't going to give her a child. But she wasn't willing to raise a child without a partner's help. Davy's help.<br><br>For the millionth time she wished she could jump, like Davy, so she could go after him, to finish this argument, or at least defuse it. She regretted their decision to live here, hidden, instead of in Stillwater where she could expose him more to her friends' kids, to family settings totally unlike his own childhood.<br><br>Instead, they commuted, Davy jumping her in and out of the condo in Stillwater, usually from the Texas cliff house, though there were extended periods of living in Tonga, Costa Rica, and one glorious spring in Paris. Still, they always came back to the cliff house. It was the only place Davy felt safe.<br><br>He'd built it shortly before the NSA first discovered him, and Davy and Millie were the only humans who'd ever been there. The surrounding terrain was incredibly rugged, a tortuous rocky desert region known as El Solitario. Since Davy's original discovery of the place, it had become more popular. The original ranch surrounding the area had been bought by Texas and made a state park. Still, the house was built into a natural overhung cliff ledge two hundred feet from the canyon bottom and a hundred feet from its top. Backpackers had made it into the bottom of the canyon but since the Aerie was on the side of El Solitario away from the trailhead, there were fifteen miles of waterless mountain desert to be crossed just to get to the bottom of the canyon.<br><br>She groped for her glasses, got up, and put the kettle on the propane burner. While it heated she started a pi�on fire in the woodstove, then browsed the shelves for a book. Davy had covered the walls in the first five years and then added freestanding double-sided shelves later. In the last two years, though, he'd finally started culling the shelves, donating books to community libraries, but his acquisition rate still exceeded his outgo and there were piles of new books throughout the dwelling.<br><br>It was three in the morning when she awoke in the reading nook, a cold pot of tea beside her and The Wood Wife fallen from her lap, that she gave up and went to bed.<br><br>Dammit, Davy! You must really be pissed.<br><br>When her alarm went off, at six-thirty, he still wasn't there.<br><br>Shit! She couldn't even cancel her clients, a husband and wife coming in for marital counseling. There was no phone---only a last-ditch 406 MHz PLB---a satellite-detected personnel locator beacon used by aircraft and ships for emergency search and rescue. It used the Global Positioning System to send its location so setting it off would put some sort of helicopter on the ridge above the Aerie fairly quickly.<br><br>She and Davy had considered a satellite cell phone for the Aerie but Davy was convinced the NSA could use it to locate the cliff house. Instead, he carried a satellite pager, so Cox could get messages to him all over the world, but it was receive only.<br><br>The Emergency PLB was just that, for emergencies. Was this one? Not yet, she decided.<br><br>He could get to the Aerie right up to seven-thirty and still jump her to the clinic on time, but her professional clothes were all in the Stillwater Condo. She wasn't even sure she had clothes here.<br><br>She ended up putting on one of Davy's flannel shirts and a pair of his jeans, which were tight in the crotch and thighs, and loose in the waist. She found a pair of her own running shoes and used Davy's socks.<br><br>For a while she stared at the picture on the bedside table, a Polaroid of both of them taken at a restaurant in Tahiti. She remembered Davy's irritation at the flash. He hadn't hesitated to buy it from the photographer. He didn't like images of himself floating around. He was going to destroy it but Millie asked him to give it to her instead. Only her promise that she would keep it in the Aerie had won him over.<br><br>There wasn't much in the propane refrigerator. She ate some Wheaties dry and drank two glasses of water. The ceramic water tank atop the refrigerator was only a quarter full when she checked the sight glass.<br><br>Come on, Davy! This isn't like you.<br><br>Seven-thirty came and went.<br><br>She rehearsed speeches of anger and pounded the bed with a stick. She read more. She paced. By midafternoon the anger had turned, like the worm, and she began to feel afraid.<br><br>She was afraid for Davy. Only death or severe injury could keep him from her. No jail could hold him, no prison bars, though, she remembered, chaining him to something solid might do it---something he couldn't jump. They'd tried that experiment once, long ago, handcuffing him to a railing. He'd nearly dislocated his shoulder. Old-fashioned manacles set in a wall would hold him nicely.<br><br>She shuddered.<br><br>A while later, she began to fear for herself.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Steven Gould<br></p><h2>Rabbi Nachman&#39;s Stories</h2><p>RABBI NACHMAN&#39;S STORIES Translated by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan The Sages always told stories to convey some of the deepest secrets about God and His relation to the creation.

Building on twenty years of research and debate, Dorie Reents-Budet and her collaborators Joseph W. Ball, Ronald L. Bishop, Virginia M. Fields, and Barbara MacLeod bring together many perspectives, including the art historical, archaeological, epigraphical, and ethnohistorical, to examine one of the world&#x2019;s great but overlooked painting traditions. With an emphasis on sixth- to eighth-century pottery featuring both pictorial and hieroglyphic imagery, <i>Painting the Maya Universe</i> presents an extraordinary exploration of the cultural roles and meanings of these Guatemalan, Belizean, and Mexican elite painted ceramics. Maya pottery is discussed both in aesthetic terms and for the important information it reveals about Maya society, artistry, politics, history, religion, and ritual. The range of ceramic painting styles developed during this period is also presented and defined in detail.<br><i>Painting the Maya Universe</i> is the first publication to present a definitive translation of the hieroglyphic texts painted on these objects. With many glyphs deciphered here for the first time, this analysis reveals much about how these vessels were perceived and used by the Maya, their owners&#x2019; names, and, in several cases, the names of the artists who created them. This information is combined with archaeological and other data, including nuclear chemical analyses, to correlate painting styles with specific Maya sites.<br>Published in conjunction with Duke University Museum of Art and an exhibition touring the United States, <i>Painting the Maya Universe</i> presents an astonishing visual record as well as a monumental scholarly achievement. With photographs by Justin Kerr, the foremost photographer of pre-Columbian art, it includes over 90 unique full-color rollout photographs, each showing the entire surface of an object in a single frame. The book also addresses the questions and controversy regarding the loss of information that occurs when objects are removed from their archaeological context to become part of public and private collections.<br><i>Painting the Maya Universe</i> will energize discussion of Maya pottery, hieroglyphic texts, and iconography. Its photographs, a lasting resource on this great painting tradition, will stimulate and delight the eye. It is a breakthrough in art history and Latin American scholarship that will enrich general readers and scholars alike.<br></p><p>&#34;The book is a magnificent and much needed assessment of how far we have come in the last twenty years and it points the way toward the kind of research and collaboration we need for the future.&#34;--from the foreword by Linda Schele, author of &#34;Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art&#34;Dorie Reents-Budet is Curator, Arts of the Ancient Americas at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Mint Museum, Charlotte, North Carolina. <br> <br>Linda Schele (1942&#x2013;1998) was the John D.

Produced and directed by Stephen Simon (producer of <i>Somewhere in Time</i> and <i>What Dreams May Come</i>) and distributed by Samuel Goldwyn Films and Fox Home Entertainment, the theatrical release is set for October 27, 2006.

Heresy! Who does this man think he is, claiming to speak directly to God?! Jesus did it, Muhammad did it, the Jewish prophets did it, but none of their Gods had the sardonic wit or raw verve of Prophet Walsch&#39;s God. Neale Donald Walsch isn&#39;t claiming to be the Messiah of a new religion, just a frustrated man who sat down one day with pen in his hand and some tough questions in his heart. As he wrote his questions to God, he realized that God was answering them... directly... through Walsch&#39;s pen. The result, far from the apocalyptic predictions or cultic eccentricities you might expect, turns out to be matter-fact, in-your-face wisdom on how to get by in life while remaining true to yourself and your spirituality.Suppose you could ask God the most puzzling questions about existence - questions about love and faith, life and death, good and evil. Suppose God provided clear, understandable answers. It happened to Neale Donald Walsch. It can happen to you. You are about to have a conversation... I have heard the crying of your heart. I have seen the searching of your soul. I know how deeply you have desired the Truth. In pain have you called out for it, and in joy. Unendingly have you beseeched Me. Show Myself. Explain Myself. Reveal Myself. I am doing so here, in terms so plain, you cannot misunderstand. In language so simple, you cannot be confused. In vocabulary so common, you cannot get lost in the verbiage.

He was a lifelong Republican, but Richard Nixon considered him a threat. Closing in on the conspiracy, Gray became the target of one of Watergate's most shocking acts--Nixon's "smoking gun" attempt to have the CIA stop the FBI investigation. And when the U.S. Senate focused its attention on Gray in April 1973, the White House threw him to the wolves; John Ehrlichman famously advised that he be left to "twist slowly, slowly in the wind."<br>&nbsp;<br>This book is Gray's firsthand account of what really happened during his crucial year as acting director of the FBI, based on a never-before-published first-person account and previously secret documents. He reveals the witches' brew of intrigue and perfidy that permeated Washington, and he tells the unknown story of his complex relationship with his top deputy, Mark Felt, raising disturbing questions about the methods and motives of the man purported to be Deep Throat.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gray's book was completed and expanded by his son, the journalist Ed Gray, who has supplemented the text with revelatory excerpts from documents, tape transcripts, and third-party accounts. Every other major figure has told his story, and now Patrick Gray's unique inside account will change the way we think about the crisis that destroyed the Nixon presidency.</p><p>L. Patrick Gray III (1916-2005) was acting director of the FBI at the height of the Watergate scandal, from May 1972 to April 1973. He had previously served in the Justice Department as an assistant attorney general, and was a twenty-year veteran of the U.S. Navy. Ed Gray, his son, is a naturalist writer and the founder of <i>Gray's Sporting Journal</i>. He is the author of seven books and lives in Lyme, New Hampshire.<p>Prologue</p><p>April 26, 1973 White House Telephone, 5:56&#x2013;6:17 p.m.</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: All right. On the Gray thing, it seems to me that Gray, that you should have your meeting with Gray immediately, the three of you. Don&#x2019;t have him make a statement, however, until&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know if he should even make one tonight. You know what I mean.</p><p>ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL HENRY PETERSEN: Yes.</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: I&#x2019;m not sure I would react that soon. I don&#x2019;t know, but at least that was Dick&#x2019;s feeling, that maybe we shouldn&#x2019;t act tonight. But under the circumstances with the destruction of the documents story, even though it was done with no venal intent, this is stupidity of an unbelievable degree.</p><p>PETERSEN: I agree.</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: And he&#x2019;ll have to resign. And who would be the best&#x2014;who is the second man over there?</p><p>PETERSEN: Mark Felt&#x2019;s the second man at the Bureau. Let me say one thing, Mr. President. You know, I don&#x2019;t give a damn whether I get that job or not.</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: I understand.</p><p>PETERSEN: You know, I think, next to the presidency of the United States, it may be the toughest job in America. . . . I don&#x2019;t want to see anybody from the inside take that job. . . . </p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: It&#x2019;s got to be cleaned out. But my point is, my point is, this is not the time, this is not the time. I&#x2019;m not ready to name Gray&#x2019;s successor. I&#x2019;m still searching, you know.</p><p>PETERSEN: I agree . . . </p><p>As I left my office on the evening of April 26, 1973, and walked down to the parking garage with my driver, Special Agent Tom Moten, neither of us spoke as we went down the steps. Tom held the silence as he pulled the Mercury out toward the officer on duty at the gate.</p><p>At the gate the guard had none of his usual pleasantries, but instead hurriedly told me that Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen had called and left word that it was urgent that I contact him.</p><p>Getting out of the car, I thanked the guard and stepped into his shack to call Henry.</p><p>&#x201c;Pat,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I just got a call from Dick Kleindienst. The president just called him and said that the story of your burning the Hunt files is going to be all over the news tomorrow and he wants to get the story himself first. Dick is coming back into the office from Burning Tree and wants to meet with the two of us at seven.&#x201d;</p><p>Word of Senator Lowell Weicker&#x2019;s selected leaks was out.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, Henry,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go up to my office first, and I&#x2019;ll meet you in the AG&#x2019;s office at seven.&#x201d;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t expected this activity until the next day, when I knew that the news stories would appear, but I was just as prepared to deal with it tonight as I would be the next day. Perhaps even more so.</p><p>Shortly before seven I walked over to the attorney general&#x2019;s office. The main double doors were locked, so I went around through the circular alcove and foyer to his conference room, intending to use the key I had for that door. These doors, however, were open, so I walked through the conference room to the secretaries&#x2019; offices and picked up a telephone to call Henry and tell him I was there.</p><p>Just at that moment I heard footsteps and I turned to see Dick Kleindienst striding into his office. I called Henry and told him that both the attorney general and I were in the office and that I would place a leather thong on the double doors so that he could come in that way. Henry said he would be right up.</p><p>Then I walked into the attorney general&#x2019;s office. Without preamble, Dick went right to the heart of the matter.</p><p>&#x201c;Pat, I&#x2019;ve been talking to the president about your burning of the Hunt files. The news inquiries are coming in thick and fast and the president wants a recommendation right now.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could respond, Henry Petersen came into the room, and Dick repeated what he had just told me. Henry didn&#x2019;t say anything, just nodded his head, and took a seat in one of the chairs in front of the attorney general&#x2019;s desk. Dick sat in his chair behind the desk and waved toward the remaining chair in front of me. It was clearly my turn to speak.</p><p>&#x201c;The news stories are coming from Lowell Weicker,&#x201d; I told them. Both of their faces went blank.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already told Lowell the truth about the files,&#x201d; I went on. &#x201c;And this afternoon at about 2:30 the senator came over to my office to tell me that he had relayed the entire story to four of his handpicked journalist friends. He said I may hate him for leaking this story but that he did it in my own best interests.&#x201d;</p><p>Kleindienst was visibly shaken. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d better go into my smaller office and have a drink,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>So the three of us went into the attorney general&#x2019;s small private office where Dick and I took seats while Henry went to the cabinet and fixed drinks. I declined.</p><p>I explained to them what I knew about the two files, which had come from the safe of E. Howard Hunt, one of the Watergate conspirators. Though I hadn&#x2019;t studied them in detail, it had been clear to me that they were copies of some sort of top-secret State Department cables, as well as some flimsy copies of muckraking correspondence about Senator Ted Kennedy&#x2019;s car accident at Chappaquiddick in 1969. I told them both, again, that when White House counsel John Dean had given me the files in the presence of John Ehrlichman, the assistant to the president for domestic affairs, both men had assured me the files were in no way connected with Watergate and that they had national security overtones. When I asked Ehrlichman and Dean if these files should be placed in the FBI files Dean responded, &#x201c;These should never see the light of day.&#x201d; I took their statements at face value, so that when I actually went to burn the files I casually flipped through them and noted for myself that these indeed were not related in any way to our investigation of the break-in.</p><p>All of this I had carefully laid out for Senator Weicker, and at this point, sitting in the attorney general&#x2019;s office with these two grim-faced men, I still fully expected that the news stories the next morning would be factual.</p><p>Dick Kleindienst apparently knew better. Or perhaps he knew something else.</p><p>&#x201c;Pat,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how you can remain acting director of the FBI.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t agree, Dick,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;It will be perfectly clear that these files had nothing to do with Watergate. And certainly the people in the FBI know that I haven&#x2019;t in any way tried to stifle the investigation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That may be true,&#x201d; Dick stated. &#x201c;But the timing of this just couldn&#x2019;t be worse. I think that the president will want you to step down.&#x201d;</p><p>Henry was nervously pacing back and forth in the small office while Dick and I remained in our chairs. The three of us discussed the pros and cons of the newspaper stories that would appear the next day, and then Dick abruptly got up.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to telephone the president,&#x201d; he said, and he left the room.</p><p>April 26, 1973 White House Telephone, 7:44&#x2013;8:02 p.m.</p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL RICHARD KLEINDIENST: Henry and I are down here at my office with Pat Gray. . . . Let me give you his version of it before we discuss the ramifications of it and I describe his attitude. Several days after the apprehension of the Watergate burglars, he was asked to come over and met in John Ehrlichman&#x2019;s office with him, and there was Dean. Part of the conversation was with John Dean, Ehrlichman saying nothing. John Dean says, &#x201c;Pat, here are some highly sensitive and very secret files that were in the possession of Howard Hunt that had nothing to do with the Watergate case. They are of a very, very secret, sensitive nature.&#x201d; He did not describe their contents. &#x201c;They should not be put in the FBI files and they should never see the light of day. Here, you take them.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the substance of it. Pat took the documents from John Dean. Then he stayed there with John Ehrlichman. Ehrlichman said nothing about the documents, and they were talking about the apprehension and concern that you had about leaks from the FBI. Pat then left that office, went home, had a few trips to make, left them at home. When he came back on a Sunday night&#x2014;I think this occurred on a Thursday or a Friday. When he came back on a Sunday night, he then took the documents down to his office without looking at them, tore them into bits, put them in his burn basket, and they were destroyed. That&#x2019;s Pat&#x2019;s story. . . . </p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: He will not say that he was ordered to destroy them?</p><p>KLEINDIENST: No. Pressed upon cross-examination as a result of what Dean said, he said that, &#x201c;I had to gather from Dean as being, you know, a representative of the President of the United States, that I had to just infer from his remarks that, since they were never to see the light of day, they were of such a highly sensitive nature, and could not be put in the FBI files,&#x201d; he just concluded himself he ought to destroy them. Now, that&#x2019;s quite a bit different, you know, than getting a specific direction,</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: Yes.</p><p>KLEINDIENST: I think if you know Pat as I do, you press him to the wall and Pat would say that the only fair inference that I could gain from my conversation with John Dean with Ehrlichman present was that they had to be destroyed. He would not say&#x2014;</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: It was Dean that told him this?</p><p>KLEINDIENST: Yes, yes. But he would not say that he was specifically ordered to destroy them. . . . So now we are talking in this vein: Pat, if you testify before a grand jury, we all have to assume that that&#x2019;s going to go out and hit the streets. . . . So suppose that this very statement that you gave us, that you made public tomorrow. You just got the press in and said, this is what happened. What would that do with respect to your ability to look after, manage, the Federal Bureau of Investigation? He said it would be a disaster. So I said, &#x201c;Pat, that&#x2019;s where we are logically. If it should come out&#x2014;and indeed it is because of all the leaks that we have&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t that where we are?&#x201d; He feels that for him to resign is an admission of guilt of some kind.</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: Right.</p><p>KLEINDIENST: And I said, &#x201c;Pat, as far as I can see you haven&#x2019;t done anything criminally wrong. But in light of all the facts and circumstances of the Watergate case&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: His ability to conduct the office.</p><p>KLEINDIENST: &#x201c;It creates just an impossible situation for you to manage that Bureau.&#x201d; And that is where we wound up before I called you, because I told him&#x2014;</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: Right, I understand, I understand.</p><p>KLEINDIENST:&#x2014;that I wanted to&#x2014;he&#x2019;s in the other room with Henry&#x2014;to report to you what he said and the context of it. Pat Gray, as you know, is a soldier and he&#x2019;s going to do any goddamn thing [you ask of him].</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: I know, I know.</p><p>KLEINDIENST: Henry and I . . . feel and we&#x2019;re trying to get across to Pat without just denuding him is he&#x2019;s got to resign. How do you want us to proceed tonight?</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: But how would we do it? He should say nothing tonight.</p><p>KLEINDIENST: Oh, I&#x2019;m not talking about tonight. I&#x2019;m trying to make a decision tonight.</p><p>PRESIDENT NIXON: Yeah. . . . </p><p>Henry was still pacing the floor, back and forth behind the leather chair I was in. My mind was going over the conversation we just had with the attorney general. Henry&#x2019;s pacing stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;Pat, I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of what?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it appears to me that you and I are expendable and Haldeman and Ehrlichman are to be saved.&#x201d;</p><p>The import of what he said didn&#x2019;t hit me right away. I answered him casually. &#x201c;Henry, I think you&#x2019;re stretching the importance of this thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pat,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not kidding. We&#x2019;re in deep trouble here.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought for a moment. There was one question I could ask that would put it in perspective.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, Henry. All right. Then let me ask you point-blank: Do you think I ought to retain a lawyer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I think you should.&#x201d;</p><p>Now I knew Henry was offering me serious advice indeed, and yet I was not alarmed. Not as much as I should have been. But in my own analysis of the situation, I just could not see how I could be viewed as being liable to the point of requiring an attorney.</p><p>I did know that men in the White House and in the Committee to Re-Elect the President had recently hired some of the best criminal lawyers in Washington, although many of them had not yet been indicted. I also knew, ever since John Ehrlichman&#x2019;s phone call to me on April 15, that John Dean had been talking to the federal prosecutors. And certainly I knew that destruction of evidence was obstruction of justice.</p><p>But I knew that I was not involved with the Watergate wrongdoings. I knew that there had been nothing illegal in my dealings with John Dean, that I had dealt with him only in his official capacity as counsel to the president of the United States. And I knew that the files I had destroyed were most definitely not Watergate evidence. Furthermore, the files had been destroyed on the direct orders of John Ehrlichman, who was certainly acting for the president.</p><p>I also knew Henry Petersen to be a thoroughly experienced federal prosecutor who was in charge of the government&#x2019;s investigation of Watergate. And now he was offering me serious advice as a friend. I had to listen.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Henry,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t know any criminal lawyers here in Washington. Aren&#x2019;t all the good ones already taken up by all these other fellows? Who would you suggest?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pat, the best man you could find anywhere, and the man I would get for myself, is my good friend Stephen H. Sachs, over in Baltimore. He was an assistant United States attorney for the District of Maryland and then United States attorney for the same district for four years. Steve is an experienced prosecutor and an extremely competent attorney. He hates corruption. He&#x2019;s also a warm and compassionate human being, and if you can convince him that you&#x2019;ve done nothing wrong, then you&#x2019;ll have a strong and very loyal advocate in your corner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Henry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve done nothing wrong. But if you think that I should do it, then I&#x2019;ll call Steve Sachs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you should do it,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>At that point the attorney general came back into the small office.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Pat,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the president wants you to stay on as acting director. But there must be no implication of a cover-up at the White House in regard to the burning of the files.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dick,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I burned those files at the clear direction of Dean and Ehrlichman, and John Ehrlichman has known since April fifteenth that I carried out his orders. There&#x2019;s nothing to cover up.&#x201d;</p><p>By now it was nearly 8:30 and time to go home. The three of us closed the office and moved out into the hall. Henry Petersen was six or seven steps ahead in the broad Justice Department hallway and Dick Kleindienst and I were walking together.</p><p>&#x201c;You know, Pat,&#x201d; he said suddenly, &#x201c;there are some things we will all have to take to our graves.&#x201d;</p><p>We walked quietly a few more steps.</p><p>&#x201c;Not I,&#x201d; I said to him. &#x201c;Not I.&#x201d;</p><p>The next day, I resigned as acting director of the FBI. I had held the job for less than a year. What follows is the story of that year.</p><p><br>Copyright � 2008 by LPGIII Pages LLC.

He has won both the RBA International Prize for Crime Writing, and the CWA Ellis Peters Historic Crime Award.</p>In the wreckage of postwar Berlin, PI Bernie Gunther--in his third appearance--accepts coal for payment and reluctantly takes on a case for Russian Col. Palkovich Poroshin, one of the despised "Ivans." Asked to prove black marketeer Emil Becker innocent of the death of U.S. Counterintelligence Corps Capt. Edward Linden, Gunther leaves Berlin (and his unfaithful wife) for Vienna, where the incarcerated Becker insists he had been set up while delivering SS files to Linden at the behest of a stranger named Konig. Gunther's search for Konig attracts the attention of the CIC's John Belinksky, who also believes Becker was framed. After saving Gunther from some drunken Russians, Belinsky asks Gunther to infiltrate the ranks of a super-secret group of ex-Nazis whose leader may be former Gestapo head Heinrich Muller. Obviously, the Nazi-hunting CIC wants Muller badly, but Belinsky drops a bombshell that brings into question his own role in the investigation. Unleashing a series of stunning revelations, Kerr ( The Pale Criminal ) discloses the reasons for the Russians' interest in Linden and for the many deaths involved in Gunther's case.
